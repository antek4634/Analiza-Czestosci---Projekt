5,"We always stay here when in Valdez for silver salmon fishing. The elderly couple that run it are amazing to talk to, extremely helpful. The campsites are very well maintained."
5,This was an amazing RV camping experience with good electric water - the owner even pumped our septic. They have a great little store with groceries and souvenirs - we got to know some of the other campers and every where we went they were very happy with the site. We used laundry and shower area and everything was very clean. Enjoy!
5,Spent the summer of 2011. Had a wonderful time.\n2014 Just spent a 2nd Wonderful summer at this park. Very nice quiet park surrounded with trees. Very clean restrooms and the park was kept clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
5,"My Wife and I have stayed at Bear Creek several times over the past 5 years, and it continues to be the only place that we'll stay near Valdez.  Tim and LaVerne are wonderful hosts, and run a great campground.  Best thing is, its a few miles out of the \""hustle and bustle\"" of busy Valdez... nice place guys!  :)"
5,"Great campground for the price. Nice hot unlimited showers, laundy, and  spacious wooded lots. Full hook ups. Late check in available."
4,"We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open.\n\nThere is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold.\n\nWi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again."
5,"I like the park, it's new still making improvements, I am Glad that I was able to get in with out a reservation, the staff is very good, cable TV needs work got one channel with antenna, no sewer at site but they do have a dump site."
4,"This place is just a few miles outside Valdez, which I thought was a bonus.  It was surrounded by woods and had some trees throughout the park for shade.  The bathrooms were clean and the showers were nice.  The dump station was a little underwhelming.  Overall, I'm really glad I stayed here and not one of the gravel lots in valdez."
5,Probably the nicest and cleanest campground we've been to in Alaska.
1,Treated terribly by owner absolutely outrageous pricing wouldn't even allow me to shower after paying almost 40.00 for just parking in a lot for 5 hours
5,Stayed there all summer in 2014 and gonna stay there this year. Great place nice people
5,"Nice people, clean bathrooms with cloth bath mats too!"
3,Noisy in the morning(RV's leaving). A little cramped. Other than that a nice place to stay.
3,"Beautful setting plenty of room for a big rig, but no sanation at the site. Strong Wi-Fi with very good cable tv. THIS IS NOW VALDEZ KOA"
5,"Great, slept like a bear. Clean, convenient, cute, the owners are a hoot."
5,"Well maintained, excellent amenities, sites are conveniently accessible"
5,Very nice cabin
5,Cool
5,It is always a treat to visit this rain or shine. So much to say but I'll sum it up with photos.
3,"We went on a Friday, it was still fun, but apparently there\u2019s less than half the usual vendors. The pictures below show the huge empty area that is supposed to be full! We were disappointed at how few stalls there were. There were maybe 20 in all, and for a long while we were the only buyers, which might explain the lack of booths. It was mostly jewelry, with a smattering of antler art and t shirts and a few (overpriced) food vendors. They said Saturday is the best day, I\u2019d definitely go then if you can!"
4,Only 3 booths with mainly vegetables. More expensive than the stores but the produce looked pretty good. The tomatoes were a nice deep red. Tomorrow I'll see if they taste better. I'm trying to eat healthier. I miss the fruits tho'.
5,We went to the mall looking for gifts to take back home but everything was closed. Luckily this market was right outside with a few vendors. We got what we needed and they had a decent selection of food and gifts. Happy to have found it despite not knowing it existed
4,Good market but kind of a small selection of vendors\u2026
2,Not a lot going on here since it moved from downtown. Check out a farmers market somewhere else. Try find where Grandma Wei moved to!
5,Love this market! Something for everyone!
3,It's ok. Wished it was at the old location.

5,"Great help, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. I was impress by the turn around time, and the fact that he was able to service my trailer so quickly. Other shops in my area were telling me that an appointment were a month out, I got serviced in two days. It was worth the trip from Anchorage. Give Max a call!"
5,Matt was honest and did the work done as promised date.
5,"Our little Scamp camper needed some TLC and Happy Camper did a wonderful job checking the electrical, window seals, and minor fixes. Professional service and excellent value - highly recommended!"
5,They are very fair and fast. Highly recommend his services.
5,"Max at Happy Camper is the best. Happy Camper installed a generator for my 5th wheel, great work. I was so pleased that I have taken my rig back for a slide out repair. No worries here."
5,Excellent work done at a fair price and in a timely manner way better pricing than the other places in the area.
5,"Extremely easy to work with. Highly accommodating.  Never once had an issue reaching him by phone. Was a little concerned at first with the couple of negative reviews but decided to try it anyway. So glad I did because I haven't received this high quality of customer service in a long time. I thought I needed a new water heater that he could have easily charged me for, turns out I didn't need one. Thats the kind of service a female like myself appreciates when dealing with repair shops. I won't take my trailer anywhere else for repairs but here."
5,Max is awesome to work with very nice guy!
2,"Unfortunately, I haven't been able to be graced by Max's great service that the other reviewers have left because I haven't been able to get a hold of him. It would be my advice to add an answering machine to the phone line, so customers could leave a message.  Based on reviews of other RV repair shops I am hesitant to have my converter replace anywhere else."
5,"I've used Happy Camper RV for three or four years. Max handles my Jayco pop-up trailer when most Alaskan repair places won't commit to it. Prices fair and on time. He works alone as far as I can tell, so gets very busy in early spring and late fall, but he schedules the work and I've only needed to schedule my drop off once. Pickup always as agreed.\n\nI really like guys who do the job without fanfare and at a good price. Max is one."
5,"I called the Happy Camper RV with a problem involving my refrigerator and needed it repaired for a trip the following day.  Though this was very short notice they got me in and made the repair in about two hours. I was flabbergasted! This is without doubt, the man I will use from now on for all of the repairs he can perform for me on my RV.  Exellent Job!  Excellent Service!"
5,Very nice and reliable.professional rv service.one of the best i have ever been to
5,"So I pull into Eagle River in Feb from Michigan pulling an overloaded toy hauler and once I get unloaded at my new apartment, I discover that my electric tongue jack has stopped working. I leave a message after business hours Friday night and get a call back Saturday morning. The owner tries walking me thru a few simple remedies to fix but after no luck, he tells me to drop it at his shop and he will take a look. On Monday morning at 10.30am, I get a call that it is fixed. When I pick it up, the jack is rewired and working AND it has been washed from 4,000 miles of crude. I was charged a very fair fee and was on my way! I am very happy with this business' service and highly recommend them!"
5,"I am so grateful to have found Max. He fixed my spring and Furnace in my Jayco Popup, when I thought it was a goner, and at a reasonable price. I am once again a \u201cHappy Camper\u201d Highly recommend."
5,"I need my refrigerator replaced,for it done quick and the job he did was awesome,very clean work performed,Thank You."
5,"We came in from out of town and had a serious problem with our base plate on a car that we were towing behind our motorhome. Called late in the day and Max returned my call and opened up a morning time to look at it. His son gave me a ride back to where the motorhome was and delivered the car there after the repair. To say I was pleased with the service would be an understatement, and he was very fair with the parts and labor. Thanks, Max."
5,Always pleased with the great quick service at a fair price.  Max is always attentive to detail.
1,"This may be a fabulous business but after two calls with messages left and no response from them, I'd have to say that they may be a really good mechanic but don't do a very good job of managing their business and customer service.  I guess I'll go to Anchorage to have my water leak diagnosed and repaired!"
5,Always pleased with the value and the work. This man loves what he does for a living.
5,"Always great service, honest and fast."
5,Max is one of the few honest guys you'll find in this racket.
5,Probably the best service in the Valley.
5,Excellent service.

5,"Do yourself a favor, do Anchorage a favor, do foodies everywhere a favor and stop by the Cajun Corner downtown and enjoy some of the best Alaskan seafood and Southern fare. The North's best Southern blessed buckets of seasoned buttery soul food. It's all in there if you want it, from King crab to crawdads. I paid for extra in the bucket but the regular portions in other dishes we saw seemed fair as well. I stopped in just to see what it was about, grab a beer and maybe a bite, I'm glad I stayed for so much more. Support local, savor the flavors and say hi to Pat who'll be throwing down all this goodness over a single stove top. The space is clean, beautifully decorated, ideally located in the heart of downtown and a great atmosphere for meeting friends. I'll be back for sure."
5,"Great place to eat. The chef, Patrick, was a fun and inviting person. He is one of those people you feel you can trust and he sure can cook some crawdads. Shannon was a great host, checking on us frequently. Great first experience."
5,Fantastic service and food!! Every bite we took here was jaw dropping! Come! Eat! Enjoy!! We loved being at the Cajun Corner!
5,Great flavor! I had the seafood gumbo and Shrimp basket. My buddies only had the Jumbalaya and said it could use more rice. For $16 they weren't full afterwards. That's not super surprising since these dishes are more expensive usually. The restaurant is newer and I expect they'll do very well.
5,Amazing place!!!!! A gem!!! We were walking around downtown looking for place to eat with no luck 
5,I had the jambalaya and the gumbo and both were the most delicious I\u2019ve ever had. The gumbo was my favorite though. Great atmosphere and extremely friendly owners. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try more!
5,Stopped in after trolley tour. Food was delicious and dessert was very good too!! Prices were comparable to area...a little bit higher than I am used to but food and service was great!!
5,"Very cool place to visit when you're in Anchorage. Friendly staff, nice local beer selection and tremendous Cajun food (coming from someone that lives on the US Gulf Coast.  Please check this place out!"
1,"The people were very nice but portions are waaaaaaayy too small for the price. For $9 I got 4 small catfish nuggets along with flavorless red beans and rice. The menu said 2 pieces of fish so I was expecting 2 catfish fillets. For the amount of food that was given, it should have been listed as an appetizer! I wish I would have taken a picture to post. I also ordered okra but it took too long so I canceled my order. Fish and beans were also room temperature. This place was newly opened but the portion sizes and the lack of flavor have nothing to do with that. Sorry but I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone and definitely won\u2019t be returning. The kitchen is also too small for what they are trying to do."
5,"THE LINE OUT THE DOOR WAS WORTH STANDING IN. WHAT A GREAT LITTLE GEM IN ANCHORAGE. HAD A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE, WITH VERY FRIENDLY SERVERS. MY FOOD WAS HOT AND FULL OF FLAVOR. THANKS!!!"
5,"Delicious! My family and I came to celebrate my dad\u2019s 53rd birthday. Everything tasted delicious, and the service was outstanding! I\u2019m glad I could check it out on my visit. Will be back for more!"
5,"Best downtown spot for Seafood and cajun food, I just had the best date her with my wife. The owner and staff were friendly and added to an already amazing experience."
5,"Great food, good beer, awesome people!\n\nJambalaya and gumbo were outstanding and the atmosphere cannot be beat."
5,"They are a new establishment. 5 days old. Great food but they are overwhelmed especially because the city favorite 49 state brewery was closed.\nShannon and her Chef are dishing out some spice to Anchorage. They need a web presence (Google, Yelp and TripAdvisor).\nGood luck. You got the recipient for the food the rest will fall in place as your clientele grows."
5,Love this place love the people  food doesn't get any more authentic than this.

Leads and supervisors don't speak English but they gave them radio, they're rude .Most disorganized company I have never seen Unbelievable. They discriminate against people that don't speak Spanish. Messed up company!!!"
5,ED ACE you should be ashamed of yourself. Having not worked there yourself how can you make such extreme accusations and then compare it to concentration camps. I hope you are more diligent with facts in other areas of your life because I can only classify your reporting as reckless.

1,"The owner doesn\u2019t know how to respect and deal with people renting the rooms. From stealing my money that was intended to be given back to me, until threatening me with the idea that he is going to call the police, the owner doesn\u2019t deserve anyone to support him. Really think twice if you\u2019re willing to live here, and if you do, remember to take pictures of everything before you are charged for damages you didn\u2019t make at all."
1,"Didn't rent a room here because of the \""run-around.\"" Could barely get ahold of the owner. And, when I did, he was in Texas! I still couldn't rent a room because, there wasn't anyone else that could do the paperwork. If you rent from here, make sure the owner is available, and has the staff needed to handle your concerns."
1,Definitely won't be staying here again the owner or so called owner his name is Chris and I tried getting my deposit back and he said I have to wait a week to see if there is any damages I said no I need my deposit now to get me another room tonight he said now ur not getting ur deposit at all and blocked my number and never even went upstairs I guess it's because he is broke and he needed it  but nowm out on the street with no where to sleep tonight
1,Not the best place I\u2019ve been. The people there were slobs and always left a mess in the bathroom. The walls are thin. Didn\u2019t feel safe.
1,"Tried to get a room, came to the place waited at the time I was supposed to be there for almost a hour, only to find out that the manager wasn't going to show up"
1,Very dirty rooms and they kicked us out a day early and went through all of our belongings and we had stuff missing then they took the keys and said they were gonna press charges and bill us $2000! Absolutely obserd
4,"Was a really good experience, the hotel management was pleasant and very helpful. Bathroom and kitchen area was clean and not in disrepair. The only thing I could say I didn't like was the big huge windows that let everyone see into the place, but that's not the worst thing to have. Definitely give this place a try if it's what you're looking for."

1,"The driver held on to my change expecting a tip. When I asked for my cash he reluctantly handed it over, slammed the trunk and told me and my 13 year old son \u201cdon\u2019t come back\u201d.\nWe will come back but will not use this service.\nExpecting a tip for a $14 fare that took him less than 10 minutes to drive?\n\nHe must read his reviews. 15 minutes after this post he texted me with expletives, obscenities, and challenged me to fight him.\n\nReally?\n\nOver $4.00?\n\nProbably a reaction to the vaccine?\n\nThe cab said \u201cCity Taxi\u201d after I called the number for city taxi. Were I the owner I would disavow this driver or claim some covid excuse as well."
4,The driver is very knowledgeable of the city and I appreciate that. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five stars is because he picked me up from the airport and then a few days later drop me off to the airport The first time I wrote with him it was amazing he told me everything about everything second time he kind of felt more like a tour guide than a taxi driver which obviously has his pros and cons.\nPros
5,Dave provided outstanding service.   plane was delayed 4 hours late into the night and he still provided us with a ride with no additional charges.  extremely friendly and very knowledgeable of the area.  he was. like our own personal tour guide.  the only taxi I will use in the future.
5,Compared to the other taxi companies in Anchorage these guys were great. The communication I got was outstanding.
1,Call for a cab and nobody showed up. After I posted this a few days later they texted me demanding I take this post down. Then tried to argue a tell me what I said. The phone operator said the wrong street I corrected the operator but they didn\u2019t pay attention and still sent there drive to the wrong location. This company is very unprofessional. Use there services at your own risk! \u26a0\ufe0f
1,"Called with reservations, never showed. Called multiple times with no help. Almost missed flight. Thankfully hotel helped and drove us personally to airport.\n\n**edit: this was at 9 am for a pick up on July 3rd, you were open"
1,Because my review was submitted at a certain time does not mean it was the time of my experience which happened 2 days before I posted my reveiw
1,I called the number listed on Google to  request a taxi and was greeted with a message machine to leave a recording.
5,"Tim went way above duty to help me get my car started. Couldn\u2019t unlock it because the battery was dead, and couldn\u2019t charge it because the doors were locked because the battery was dead so he made extra trip  To come back and jump it and now it\u2019s charging! Thank you so much Tim for your help."
4,Hard to get ahold of.
3,Very slow company..
5,"So awesome, so much better than yellow taxi who 9/10 times I do not have a good experience with. We got a few rides today and had such a good experience. The driver, who was the owner, was kind and spoke to us in a way that I really appreciated. The car itself was very nice on the inside and very clean and tidy. Any time we\u2019re in anchorage we\u2019ll definitely be using their services in the future as well. Great company overall"
1,"I called to order a cab and they were friendly. I got offered a ride from a nice person I met at moose\u2019s tooth and called back to cancel about 4 minutes after. The response I got was \u201coh yeah, just waste peoples time\u201d. I got offered a free ride, and called to let them know. I am also a cab driver in Homer, and I appreciate when people let me know when they have secured another ride. I will never call this business again. A bad attitude gets you NO WHERE. Appreciate when someone lets you know they won\u2019t be there, I could have left you hanging.\n\nIn response to the owner of this business posting my private information online, I would have to say there is your proof that this company is unprofessional and untrustworthy. If you have a negative experience with them and chose to review them, they will retaliate. Thank you city taxi for proving my point for me."
5,First class service.  A delight to find in a taxi service.
1,"WOW... Did this company really just release someone's personal number...? That seems very unprofessional. Let me get this straight. You got a bad review, and lashed out with someone's personal info? Say there, what's your number? I'd like to share it with.... NO ONE! Because that doesn't seem right."
5,Great experience. This was my first ride with City Taxi. The car was very clean - didn't smell bad either (bonus points!). The driver was on time and professional. I'm definitely going to use this company as my primary taxi from now on. Highly recommend!
1,Looking at your reviews tonight while choosing a cab service for an upcoming trip to Anchorage - an owner who berates folks for their political beliefs and posts folks phone numbers is someone I'll never do business with and recommend to others that choose other options as well. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! Stay classy Mr. Business owner - I AM NOT an internet stalker. I'm a person who reads reviews on businesses. You are a simple cyber bully who does not wish to correct YOUR UNPROFESSIONAL WRONGS!
1,"Scheduled a ride through the app (the day before) and they never showed up. Didn't answer their phone or call back. Won't be trying them again!\n\nEdit: I see the owner has responded 9 months later. After I left the review, they texted me to say \""sorry about yesterday you fell through the cracks plus we've got some flu at the shop here\"" (that's a direct quote) and offered to reimburse my fare (up to $25) with the other taxi company I ended up taking - which seemed like a pretty clear admission that they had dropped the ball. I never responded because this had been a ride scheduled to the airport to catch an early flight for work, and a $25 reimbursement couldn't change the fact that I'd been left scrambling for a ride at the last minute. Not sure why they are trying to change their story now. This was my first time using their app, but I am computer/phone/app-literate and paid close attention because this was an important ride; the app had indicated that my ride was confirmed and certainly didn't say anything about taxis being unavailable. That was a failing somewhere in the app or company rather than user error. I wish City Taxi well and hope they have improved their process so as not to leave customers hanging, but I still won't be using them (or trying to!) again."
1,Numbers down not sure of this company is still in buisness.

5,"Great service. Arrived early, car was very clean, and customer service was spot on. Would recommend."
5,"On time, polite, good drivers, shares information about the city and State of Alaska."
5,Very quick to respond with a taxi after requesting one. Seems like a good alternative to yellow and checker cabs.
1,"I got cut off by cab #169, no blinker, almost hit my car so I honked and he flipped me off.  Called it in and the owner answered- no apology just arguments.  Never heard of this company but I work at a hotel and would rather sit and wait for Yellow Cab to answer than use City Taxi"
1,"Very rude people. I had to call back and ask for a taxi that would fit 4 adult and a kid, the man who answered rudely said you know what we can\u2019t keep sending taxis out to you just call someone else. No one even came out and showed up. So how would it hurt to send someone with a bigger car. Very disrespectful. Don\u2019t take this cab company just can yellow cab their much nicer. If I could rate this zero stars I would"

Just good people to work with, Greg gave me some tips last year to help keep my fish fresh and he is spot on. Looking forward to this year and the years to follow. 2015 I will have my 10 year old grandson with me and will want him to see how they handle his catch."
5,"Shop here for the best seafood in all of Alaska. I sure do miss you guys.\nRespectfully,\nNanette Jackson-"
4,"My favorite part of this establishment was eating lunch here. The food was very good.\n\nThe other part I liked about this place is after a day of fishing, Doug the manager, was waiting for us at the dock where he took our Halibut catch to Coastal Cold Storage to process for shipping back to Nebraska.\n\nWe added some smoked salmon strips (yum) and some rockfish to our shipment and we are stocked until our next return to Petersburg"

1,"There are two coffee shops in Petersburg. I come to this one because the wifi is pretty good. I come in, order my coffee, and try to connect to the internet, the wifi is down. I tell the girl behind the counter, she says that she will check on it after she makes all the coffee. There is no one else here, the internet is still down.  Very bad customer service. Will not come here again. Will tell everyone so know not to come here again."
5,"Perfect if you just want a good coffee with free Wi-Fi. They also have bagels, muffins etc. And don't miss their iced teas!"

2,Coffee is good for a while but a smile could change a DAY!
5,I love this cafe I recommend it
5,Quality local radio. Lots of awesome live performaces from Alaskan artists here. A nice place where nice people are.
5,"The KTOO building houses KTOO, KXLL and KRNN, our local public radio stations. The building has several recording studios as well as a public studio space which can be used for public broadcasts or events.\n\nKTOO is also home to 360 North, a television station focused on public and regional affairs. Gavel Alaska is a service of KTOO that brings coverage of the geographically isolated state legislature to remote parts of the state.\n\nEveryone in the building is super friendly and helpful, like they're all characters from some 1970's episode of Sesame Street."
5,Great staff as well as divergent programming! Love to listen to the station!

5,The kids pool is Sooooo warm.
5,"Old school, but my favorite pool in Juneau for what I do (mostly laps)."
5,"I love this pool. It's an old facility and doesn't have a lot of fancy stuff, but it does its job being a center of community very well."
5,"Clean, well-staffed, salt-water! Remember quarters for the lockers."

3,We would here mostly just to mail some postcards. We didn't stay long because we felt more like covid threats than customers.
5,It's one of my favorite shops in Juneau.  There is so much to discover and you couldn't find nicer people to help you.  It's locally owned and a huge supporter of Juneau!  It's a true gem in Downtown Juneau!
5,Fun artsy shop! I love that they only sell handmade jewelry. We also bought some items that they shipped to us. Everything went smoothly and the employees are very fun and helpful! Cutest stuff here. Gotta check it out!
5,One of my favorite stores in all of Alaska. Every visit to Juneau calls for a visit however brief it may be to Kindred Post. They have the very best greeting cards and post cards. Plus they make it so easy to mail just about anything. The staff here are always so welcoming and warm. The very best of Juneau!!
5,"I found this shop on my last visit to Juneau and highly recommend it. There\u2019s a contract Post Office inside and they make shipping easy with a large supply of boxes, a space to pack and label your items, and free tape and bubble wrap. The gift shop portion has a great selection of really interesting items. But their best feature is their incredibly friendly staff."
5,By far the coolest post office I've ever been to. They have a great little stationary/gift shop and they host community events. Great people who support great causes.  They seem to understand the importance of relationships.
5,Awesome! A post office? Sure. But the quality of goods they have for sale here is like nothing I've seen anywhere else. Looking for a gift to give to family back home?  This place is great. A slice of individuality in an area with lots of the same stuff for sale.
5,"Best post office ever!  Great location; quick, friendly service; delightful art, unique gifts and souvenirs.  Popular with locals and tourists alike."
5,Never met a person who doesn't love this place. Truly one of the best things about downtown Juneau.

5,Would definitely recommend. Professional care and courteous staff.
2,The front desk gal could be nicer on the phone. When we were trying to figure something out she rushed off the phone and pretty much hung up on me. When it's something as serious as patient confidentiality I wouldn't expect such rudeness from a doctors office. Just trying to help so it didn't happen again. All over I disliked my phone call I had with another provider and I hope that's not how they treat their patients over the phone.
5,The best care for young kids in Juneau. Love the staff and all their support.

5,"Fishermen's Bend is a card-lock gas station with no on-site staff. It has the lowest gasoline prices in Juneau. The station used to have a store as well, but that burned down in 2008."
5,This area is a beautiful nature scenic fishing area. We waited here for our Whalewatching expedition to begin. It's on a beautiful bay area. There are eagles everywhere. It's a must to do in Juneau Alaska!!

1,"My kids was playing at your playground this afternoon and my 5 year old daughter needed to use the restroom. Went inside your school thinking it would be ok to use the restroom since the door is open and I was also thinking that it is a public school and not a private school. This lady came up to me and ask me if she can help us and I said no, we are just using the restroom. Right away she told us your restroom is not a public restroom and I said why and she said because there is rally going on. The rally class was on the other class room and didn't even notice us because their door was closed. I asked what would be the consequence since my daughter already used the restroom? She said in a rude way I'm going to ask you to leave and I'm not going to call a police. Shocking to me being new here how rude she was. My daughter did not even make a mess or wet the floor after washing her hands,etc. Suggestion to the principal you should put a sign on your door NO PUBLIC RESTROOM so that people like us that is new in Juneau would be aware not to use your restroom."

1,The clothes are ok but the owner will more than likely put up a big fuss about returns!!! She does not have a thing posted in her store about not exchanging or returning clothing. I tried returning a couple of clothing items that were a gift for a good friend that did not fit and she pitched a real fuss even though the items were returned right away within days and the items had the price tags on them and were unworn. I have done business for years and purchased clothes in her store. Never again!!
5,Customer service is excellent.  You're also left alone to stroll around. She is diversified in what she carries. Boutique style clothing and unique styles. You should check it out!
5,I love La Boheme and find that I have more success shopping at this great local store than when I travel to Seattle.

5,Had a great time! I like hitting the course in the spring and fall before everything has grown up. It makes it way easier to find a disc when it has gone astray.
1,"This course is completely unsafe to play.  My 11 year old daughter fell into a mud hole 3 feet deep right in the middle of the course on hole 5.  I could barely pull her out, and she twisted her ankle in the process.  Who in the hell would build a disc golf course in the middle of a swampy bog?  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen."

5,Know the mechanics personally. Very hard working honest men. Will be taking all my vehicles here when they need service or repair.
5,I feel pretty confident that I will be given good advice and expert service whenever I have Aftershock work on my '98 Expedition. They keep it safe and running. Have used them several different times over the years.
5,"I've been a customer of Aftershock automotive since shortly after they opened. In my 50 years of owning a vehicle and needing repairs,Tracy and company are the best overall auto shop I have ever used. Honest, willing to take on hard jobs, not just the quick buck ones, and their prices are very competitive. Trust is the big thing. I trust them, because they have always returned me a working vehicle and they back their work. This is a professional shop, with professional people, plus they are good, fun people too. My highest recommendation. Chuck Giza"

Although, atleast when I rented, they do not offer loss-damage waiver (LDW) or Collision Damage Waiver (CDW).\n\nLooking into a credit card that offers primary coverage as opposed to secondary coverage would be worth the investment. There are only a few CC that offer that option, so choose wisely"

The Dentists and all of the employees are very friendly and knowledgeable. I got my teeth cleaned, a filling and a wisdom tooth extraction all in my first visit! I strongly recommend BTY Dental in Mountain View, I\u2019ll be coming here for all my dental needs from now on."
5,Great customer service helped me decide want plan I wanted and was really helpful!
5,"I went in for a cleaning and routine exam, and was very happy to be seated and dealt with very quickly and professionally. It all went well, and the dentist didn't even beat me up too bad about my not flossing :-). I have spent way too many hours in my life in the dentist chair, but the short time I was there today was, while not exactly pleasant, certainly not at all traumatic. I would highly recommend these folks if you need any dental work done.\nEdit:. Went back to the same place and had two teeth extracted. Once the insurance paperwork was taken care of, I was only in the chair for like 40 minutes to have both teeth pulled out and ready to leave. Whatever they use for a numbing agent works really well, didn't feel any pain and even 3 days later minimal problems. Once again, two thumbs up and strongly recommend!"

1,"So long story but they're scammers for people in the military! I went in to have an exam and fillings done and the total came out to 400$! I thought that was completely wrong!! So I called my insurance and turns out I was right! I should've only been paying 50$ for the all the fillings and when I called BTY to confront them all they said is they haven't received their money from my insurance and that I still needed to pay and would not get reimbursed I literally went the other day insurance takes a bit to take over...and they wanted their money up front with running it through my insurance, they also said I needed 2 crown and I got a second opinion because I'm only 19! And I've never had a problem with my teeth so I went to another dentist to look and he said nothing was wrong with my teeth and I probably didn't need the fillings to begin with and they did such a bad job on the fillings too to the point my gums and teeth hurt so bad I can't stop crying"

1,"We have never been to any of the bty Dental clinics before and we won't be returning.\n\nUnderstandably we arrived and were informed they were behind about 30-45 minutes and we made the decision to reschedule for a different day.\n\nThen next visit we went to the appointment early and had to practically lay down on the couch while waiting (personal preference: that's not a good thing, I'd like to sit up not lay on high traffic furniture) but when we got called back into a exam room, we were going to be waiting bit longer and that's when I noticed things...  there was a patients x-ray's up and locked on the computer screen with a name, DOB, the floor was filthy, chairs, bed and trays weren't clean and had little bits and splatters on them, these items that should be routinely wiped down. I'm not going to let anyone put potentially unclean tools in my child's mouth. I was like nooope.  I took my child and walked out.\n\nI can't speak for the people as we didn't interact with the employees much but those experiences alone will have me not returning."
5,"My visit at Bty Dental was very pleasant, the staffs were really nice and the doctor job was pretty good done !! I'm happy"
5,"ANYONE GOING TO ANHC GO HERE INSTEAD!!! ANHC screwed up me and at least one other person's teeth because all they care about it going through as many people as they can.\n\nOn my first visit to BTY dental I liked them better than the dentist I had for my entire childhood. They actually ask you what kind of appointment you'd like. Quick but thorough, or slow and steady, talking or no talking, it's like they actually care about their customers! Bye ANHC you suck."
5,I had a wonderful and fun experience. They have really good dental asstiances with great customer service. I truly enjoyed mayra and dr. Mann. I do recommend this dental office
5,"Kimberly, Hunter, and Dr. Cha I had a wonderful experience, I walked in so scared and nervous they made me feel welcomed and everything was on point\ud83d\ude18"
5,Definitely recommend ! Got my wisdom teeth out probably under 30min only !!
5,The experience was awesome and i recommend dr.manesh and his assistant myra they made it wonderful i love it.
5,Dr. Cha is an amazing dentist and his assistant clairabelle was beyond an amazing person also i would definately recommend patients here all of the staff are very pleasant.
5,"Awesome Dr Man and assistance Willow, Cory fast and painless."

1,"ZERO STARS isn\u2019t an option. AAA Moving and Storage dba Allied Alaska. Too bad. Bad. Bad bad bad. We did an \u201cinternational move\u201d with these guys (Alaska to Massachusetts) that cost us over $20K. This is just a sample of how they packed our stuff. \u201cPacked\u201d \u2026 well, not really\u2026 more like tossed stuff in a box. That black bag is a tuxedo. You can see the assistant manager\u2019s card there in the box\u2026 don\u2019t call him\u2014call someone else. ANYONE else. My retirement case was wrapped in brown paper with a bit of cardboard on the face and back. Destroyed\u2014can\u2019t replace it. If you\u2019re military and stuck with these guys\u2014watch them like a hawk\u2014they do not care. And they NEVER initiated a call to let me know where our stuff was\u2014we had to call and beg to get status, and call and call and call. And they just didn\u2019t care once they had a check."
1,"In summary: Poor communication, poor customer service. Understandable that COVID has led to delays and set backs (on many fronts), but you can read the timeline below and judge for yourself.\nI did not end up using this company for my move due to so much miscommunication during the booking process.\n\nJune 26: Filled out Quote Request on website for a move date in mid-July. Completed video survey after speaking with agent on the phone.\n\nJuly 7: Had not yet received a quote by email, so I called their office. Quote was sent to me via email.\n\nJuly 9: I responded with my interest, expressing my desired move date to be the week of July 13. Agent Justise Johnson was kind enough to answer questions.\n\nJuly 10: I was asked by this same agent if I could be flexible with my move date, as they could not find any movers until Aug 6. I replied that I would prefer the week of July 13th, because I would have to extend my lease beyond Aug 1.\n\nJuly 15: No response, so I called their office. I spoke with Justise again, who stated that they could not do any better than Aug 6th, but they would contact me if they can find a moving company to move any sooner.\n\nJuly 21: No response (at this time I had already extended my lease), so I sent a follow-up email asking to see if anyone was available before Aug 6, and confirmed that Aug 6th would be acceptable if earlier was not available.\n\nJuly 27: No response, so I sent a follow-up email asking about a move time for Aug 6th.\n\nJuly 30: No response, so I sent a follow-up email about my follow-up email. I also called the office and left a message.\n\nJuly 31: No response, called the office again and left a message. Called Allied Van Lines, who transferred me to Coleman Group. Coleman Group got a hold of another agent (who was not my primary agent) who emailed me shortly after my call with Coleman Group. The email stated the following:\n\n\u201cThe earliest that we can get a company out there to pick your goods up is 8/12 \u2013 8/14.  We are currently in the middle of peak season and every moving company is booked at least 2 weeks out, if not more.  I can get you scheduled for one of those days if you would like.\u201d\n\nI called this agent back because I was frustrated by the lack of communication. She was frustrated on her end too, because understandably she was just opening up my file. Her response: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have signed paperwork from you. Do we even have a moving survey?\u201d\n\nThey did have a moving survey. They did not have signed paperwork. Was that supposed to be sent to me at some point during these few weeks of correspondence? This was my first time ever looking into/planning to use a moving company. I did not have much experience with the \""norms\"" of moving, but I think that weeks of lapsed communication is unacceptable.\n\nI am 5 days out from my move and have to think of a Plan B!"
5,They packed my belongings very well. No problems with damage. Fast shipping and delivery when my things arrived. Awesome service.
5,"Great experience. Movers were prompt, handled my stuff well, and very professional. Jon and Jorge were fast too."
2,Half of our bedding is broken and out accessories and they broke every song piece of glass we had. Also they tried to be sneaky and not put down the stuff that they took (Silver car rims and two TVs) on to the paper with the numbers but still wrote it down on the other paper. I am flabbergasted by the stupidity and audacity of these movers.
5,Jorge and Kai were very friendly and professional they handle my things with extreme care and did everything in a timely manner definitely recommended!
2,"Our goods made it in a timely fashion, but our television was destroyed. The company has not refunded us even after 4 months."
1,"We just received our household goods. Not only was nothing labeled \u201cfragile\u201d, half of our things were broken. As well as they managed to just throw our weapons in with everything else and they all fell out when the door was opened to the crate. As of right now we are missing a weapon. Not only did the movers ignore me while I tried to give direction, they would only deal with my husband and threw everything together. I had to tell them multiple times to pack things and they seemed irritated when I\u2019d ask them to pack it. Now we have to file claims and go through everything to make sure other high value items aren\u2019t missing."
5,"We called in despair, needing to get the last of our possessions moved between homes.  A friend had recommended AAA after their move in Fall 2012. Laurie was able to schedule us in the next day! Tino and Misa worked quickly and efficiently to pack and move everything. I really appreciated their efficiency and professionalism. Out of desperation, came relief by way of AAA Moving and Storage. While it wasn't cheap, it was cheaper than another mortgage payment! We would use them again any day."
1,"I was almost killed by two Allied truck drivers. If these people don't care about safe driving, I highly doubt they care about your valuables. Maybe think about training your drivers to stop at red lights."

5,"We would highly recommend this tour!    It was a great way to get a quick understanding of the context and layout of the city, as well as an entertaining introduction to the historical significance of this area.  We were a family with three teenagers that was visiting Seward for the first time.  Jonas picked us up at the train depot in an immaculate van. He was friendly, courteous and relaxed.  What we particularly enjoyed was his personal connection to this place.  He shared stories from his youth in Seward and pointed out sights that we never would have found on our own.  Jonas smoothly guided us through multiple sights - town highlights, glaciers, salmon runs and eagles nesting - while engaging thoughtfully with the many questions from our kids.  While it is easy to enjoy the beauty of Seward on the surface, it was way more impactful to have this tour.  Now, we feel like we can appreciate it at a deeper level.  Time and money well spent!!!"
5,Jonah was incredible! He showed us all around Seward  and he was extremely knowledgeable of the history. It made our vacation extra special
5,"Seward City Tour is awesome! My husband and I received high quality service at a very reasonable price. Seward City Tour picked us up from our place at the Seward Military Resort and took us to least 4 wonderful places: city tour, tour to the Exit Glacier, visit to the Sea life Center and a delicious lunch at Ray's. The tour guide, Jonah is very knowledgeable about the history of Seward, he made sure we spent our day to the fullest in learning about the city of Seward and experience the beauty of Exit Glacier and the Sea life Center.  My husband and I highly recommend Seward City Tour."
5,This tour has great info and history about Seward. Our tour guide was friendly and professional. This is a great way to start your trip in Seward.
5,"My husband and I both give our strongest recommendation to Seward City Tours. Their service is excellent and really added to our enjoyment of our visit to the City of Seward. We arrived by train and the tour guide was waiting for us on the platform. As we walked toward the bus, he called us by name and introduced himself as Jonah. Jonah was an excellent guide, a life long resident of Alaska and Seward; he was very familiar with state and local history. Jonah was also able to relate personal experiences growing up and living in Seward that added a special charm to the tour.\n\nIn addition to the friendly and knowledgeable guide, the tour itself was a perfect blend of activities. Segments of guided touring were interspersed with free time where we were able to enjoy an excellent meal at a local restaurant, tour the Seward Sea Life Center, and take a short hike up to a glacier. At the end of the tour, we felt we knew the lay of the land and something of the culture of Seward, and were comfortable striking out on our own to get a closer look at some of the sights of this beautiful local and wonderful community.\n\nWe have been on other tours in various places, but we both agree we that this tour was a great experience that set the tone for our entire visit. We have never felt as welcome as we did in Seward. Thanks Jonah!"
5,Great way to see this little town and you get the grand tour and see all the wall art on the buildings they have some very nice ones
5,"Fantastic way to spend your time after disembarking your Inner Passage cruise. We booked the Alaskan Dome train for 6pm and were unsure what to do. Jonah and his wife were amazing. Took our luggage to the train station, and then took us to see the sites and lunch for the next four hours depositing us at the train in time for our departure. Jonah is an amazing host and so nice. Support these people as they are so great."
5,Seward City Tours is a must if your wanting a tour from someone who really knows and loves the area. Jonah went above and beyond. My husband and I really enjoyed the tour and Jonah's personality is amazing!
5,Great tour if Seward with the owner and operator!  Great to have a native/local of Seward give the tour.  Thanks Jonah!
5,"This bus tour was a great introduction and orientation to Seward.  Our driver was very personable and informative about the history of the town, things to see and do, places to eat.  The highlight was a short stop along the water where we saw sea otters, sea lions and even a humpback whale just off shore - without having to pay hundreds of dollars for a whale watching boat excursion!  Our driver said that the SeaLife Center in Seward was a must see.  He was absolutely right!"
5,"We had a tour with Jonah yesterday\nGreat tour and very knowledgeable, personable tour by someone who was born and raised in the area\nLow key sales approach (none) and we had a great day\nExtremely recommended for a good value and a great day"
5,We happened upon Jona at the train depot. He was professional and courteous.  His van was clean and newer. He gave us a great city tour with a lot of local tid bits. He was really enthusiastic about Seward. We had an included lunch at Rays which was delicious.  We visited the Sea life park and Exit Glacier with a stop at an Eagles \ud83e\udd85 Nest.\n\nIt was a great tour and I recommend the company highly\n\nFYI the walk to exit glacier viewing  is about one mile round trip. It is a well maintained relatively flat walk
5,"What a wonderful experience!  Jonah, who is a native seward resident, gave a wonderful tour with lots of very informative stories.  Yen was very kind on the phone and helped set up our group.  They were very accommodating since we had a couple special requests. They also had some good suggestions on where to eat and what to see. Jonah picked us up at the port, took us on a wonderful tour,  gave us time to eat lunch and walk the city and then brought us to our hotel in Anchorage. We were celebrating our parents 60th wedding anniversary and our parents really enjoyed the whole trip.  Thanks to SewardCity tours for the incredible service!"
5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our tour with Jonah.  We met him at the disembarkation center for Norwegian, and spent a wonderful afternoon getting to know him and Seward."

5,"WOW! Sitting here in the airport on my way home from Alaska, looking through all of my photos from the past week with Black Ops Valdez and already wishing I was back in that heli!\n\nI was taken care of from the minute I arrived ... they even arranged for my ski bag to come over from Anchorage in a shuttle after it was bumped off the flight and would have delayed my trip for days.\n\nTOP NOTCH HELI SKI GUIDES, truly the best of the best - veteran big line skiers and world class athletes who spend time with you to make sure you feel completely comfortable with each line before skiing it. We were dropped onto the landing zone, met by killer powder and then took a sunset run onto a glacier and then swept back to base for a cheers and welcome back.\n\nWe also had a day of cat skiing and drank high end scotch in a glacier ... barely felt like real life!\n\nThere is a reason that people come to Black Ops Valdez year after year and new clients seek them out ... they are truly THE BEST!"
5,"What an experience!   This operation is top notch all the way from the skiing to the accommodations and food.   The staff and the guides were fantastic.  Although the snow conditions were not ideal, our guide (Jerry is the Man) found us great untracked snow and some of the best turns I\u2019ve had the pleasure to experience.  The scenery was also breathtaking.  Completely lived up to my bucket list dreams.   Highly recommended you do this if you can."

1,"I walked in to the public library with my sister and mother to use the computer but they were shut off. I walked back to my mom and sister then an old man who works at the library told me if I had a book, i said \""no\"" he told me I had to leave if I wasnt going to read. I walked to an area inside the library near the bathrooms and some kids came in the room after I did, they sat and played video games the old  man came in and asked the kids the same question he asked me, they also said \""no\"" he told them they cant sit and play games. The female staff are kind and I never have problems with them. I hope the public library helps deal the old man who works at the library."

5,"New coffee shop, the first business run by the local tribe in Saxman. Good coffee, nice location, convenient for a drink before or after going to the totem museum \ud83d\uddff"
5,"Tastiest \""xtra tuff\"" chai and place to enjoy it on the island! Large, yet warm and cozy coffee spot/community space that takes you back to the good times before *bucks. LOVE IT!"
5,An excellent espresso pull in a beautiful spot run by wonderfully nice people!
5,Actually pretty cool place. Definitely not a typical lame ketchikan spot. Kind of reminds me of a native south side version of green coffee bean. 
5,Great cup of coffee and meeting place.  Beautiful view of Tongass Narrows
5,"Amazing, quality coffee. So glad to have Koot\u00e9eyaa in Ketchikan."
5,"Excellent coffee house just at the entrance to the Saxman Totem pole village. Kooteeyaa is Tlingkit for totem. The building also serves as the meeting place for the council. When we got there, 5th generation Haida artist Lee Wallace was demonstrating his carving skills. He is known for the totems at the Cape Fox Lodge. They formally will have a grand opening September 8."

1,"UPS is a joke in Juneau, and they should have some self respect and shut down, let USPS and FedEx handle everything. The last 3 times I ordered something UPS, it has ended up in Anchorage for a \u201csecurity check\u201d that lasted over a week\u2026 tell me, why does it take a week to check headphones? A laptop? And even a backpack?! It\u2019s so bonkers. When I try to go to the customer center to get answers, they\u2019re only open for 2 hours a day, and when I can finally get in, the employees are just and clueless as me, and rude to boot. I will be extra careful never to have anything shipped through UPS ever again, and UPS corporate should take note\u2026 this location is a stain on their entire reputation."
1,"If it were not for Amazon returns via UPS, I wouldn't choose UPS in Juneau, very limited weekday hours, very inconvenient, need a car to get to their location.  I came during their daytime, found the door locked, later informed they were short on personnel.  Another time, I tried to place a package in their outside collection boxes, my Amazon return package was too big to fit inside completely, the package was never received.  My first choice is USPS, even with its current degraded service, it's just more convenient with multiple locations, longer hours of service."
1,UPS is not able to serve Juneau in a timely manner. Use the United States Postal Service (USPS) for much faster service.
5,May be hard to find but good service!
1,"I have never received a package delivered by this company in a timely manner. It is overly common for packages to bypass the city I live in and sit in Anchorage for 3 to 5 business days, not including weekends. At this point, if I can avoid internet purchases that do not use UPS, I will do so. The latest frustration is yet another package sitting in Anchorage for 6 days. It\u2019s maddening to spend hard earned money on needed items and know that the company that is paid to deliver them will let them sit for days."
1,DO NOT USE UPS IN JUNEAU! Packages leave the lower 48 in a timely manner only to sit in Anchorage for a week or more. You'll have better luck getting a personal response from Santa Claus than a local UPS agent. Choose FedEx if you're given an option.
1,UPS service in Juneau is very poor. Expect 7 day delays for an 'overnight' delivery
5,Always great dependable service
1,I ordered AirPods from Best Buy and they hot shipped for next day air it has now been almost 5 days and they keep saying it\u2019s getting stopped by security 2 times a day I mean man cmon  you guys as a shipping company should really get that figured out because usps doesn\u2019t have that problem it\u2019s just completely annoying I wish I could choose who\u2019d they ship my package with
1,Left a 137 package blocking my retired neighbor's driveway and in the rain so it would get ruined.
1,"Update your hours when they dramatically change.\n\nUsing UPS in Juneau has been exceptionally frustrating: not only do residents here rely on this service more because we aren\u2019t on the road system, but the normal operating hours for dropping off a package are extremely limited (typically 9-11am and 7-8pm).\n\nNow, several months into the COVID-19, UPS suddenly changes their operational hours to one hour ONLY in the morning, with NO NOTICE here that the hours have changed.\n\nThis is ridiculous. Some basic communication with the public would be helpful."
1,"Said attempted delivery. I was HOME and nope, no one knocked on my door. Called UPS and got runaround for 30 minutes trying to locate package. Really???? Are you kidding me? Their service has certainly declined greatly."
2,There hours of Business is terrible. Wish there\u2019s a ups had more employees for longer hours and/or a place to drop off your boxes
1,"I order from Amazon a lot.  I have never had an issue with delivery UNTIL late last week.  Apparently \""Drive\"" was not on the address and the driver didn't deliver the box since the \""address was incomplete.\""  Drive is NEVER on my address yet I get all of my packages whether it is UPS or USPS.  This is VERY annoying to say the least.  Good luck, people.  Obviously the driver who couldn't figure out the street without the \""Drive\"" in the address is not the brightest bulb in the box.  /rolls eyes/  I hope I get the box tomorrow after \""sweetly\"" registering my concerns with the customer service clerk at UPS.  (doing this again since it didn't show up_)"
1,"They said I could pick up my package today, so I went to get it. Then they told me that it was still in anchorage. After an hour and a half a delivery driver showed up to my house to give it to me. Then she told me she was unable to give me my package because it must be picked up. The hub was already closed."
1,Yeah. It\u2019s just as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe.  Dealing with pickups or the single tiny drop-box and never being able to reach a person in the same town is a royal PITA.
5,The staff was super friendly in helping me mail out some textbooks. I came in with only the books and a shipping label and the guy at the front was really helpful and nice chatting with me. Made my day.
1,"Id have given zero stars if possible. I've had several amazon packages delivered by UPS this month. One was left, opened, halfway up the staircase to my apartment. It was abox of items that were dangerous and thousands of dollars. Defenitely items that should have had a signature!! Another box, left atmy door, had also been opened or just beat up sooo bad the box had opened in transit. And the last box, wasnt left (the only thing that wasn't valuable) but a sticky note was left on my door with nothing filled out, no instructions NOTHING. terrible terrible shipping company."
1,"I wasn't going to bother leaving a review (it doesn't change anything about how this store operates) but... my work ordered some pretty expensive, custom manufactured filters for a very important vent hood that keeps me from breathing toxic chemicals, and UPS delivered them bent, broken and leaking carbon. It took 3 months to get these parts and now they're worthless.\n\nThis morning, I got up early to drop off my textbooks (because Amazon only uses UPS) and both drop boxes were already full, one was even overflowing. I was able to stuff my books in to where they wont be stolen but WTH? UPS, YOU SUCK.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nAGAIN, I am expecting a package that is temperature sensitive, but the company that shipped it did not send me a tracking number. So I call the 800 number to see if they can look it up by our delivery address, and the lady tells me my address \""doesn't exist\"" and refuses to give me any local contact information for the UPS here in town. And of course they are closed, the Friday before Christmas, at 1pm. If we had any other choice, we would NEVER use UPS again. This package cost over $200 to ship. The only redeeming quality of UPS Juneau is the nice guy who delivers everything. Otherwise UPS YOU SUCK."
5,"I've been having difficulty receiving parcels while working in Juneau. Until I started picking them up here! This place is awesome! Always friendly staff, always helpful. There really is only one drawback:  the odd hours. I don't mind it, though, and just plan around them."
1,I have been waiting since the 4th for a 2 lb package to arrive at my apt. Today is the 13th of may. I called 3 times an was told it will be there tomorrow or its on the truck to be delivered. I signed up for the my ups and it says im not signed up. Then it says i am but i cant do anything tothe website cirlce jerks ne
5,"Jamie delivered my packages today. They were heavy and he so kindly helped me put them inside. Really nice guy, all my packages arrived on time and in perfect condition."
4,Convenient to the airport easy to find. And parking available
3,"Limited hours are a pain, but they have mid-morning and evening opportunities, so it's not too bad.  My frustration was that there was a differing opinion between the online store I was returning items to and UPS over the safety of shipping a device with an internal battery.  UPS would not accept without labels/paperwork and online store insisted that it didn't need any special handling.  Because of this, I couldn't send the package via courier to UPS and had to make an in-person trip.  The counter-person was helpful, even though he wasn't \""officially\"" allowed to give me any instructions on how to fill out the paperwork (wha?).  And I had to furnish my own \""danger, battery!\"" stickers, which I simply xerox-ed off another package.  All-in-all, it took me 5 weeks (because of back-and-forth with UPS/courier), plus the 10 minutes in the warehouse to return my package.  So, not great, but not bad.  Definitely could benefit from additional hours and permission to assist customers with paperwork."
1,"They keep telling me that my package cannot be delivered due to \""severe weather\"" even though it is a sunny day today. Good luck speaking to a human who actually lives here or being told truthful answers. I suggest going with another option for shipping to Juneau. True, I wouldn't have written a negative review if everything workout out perfectly, but this is my first experience with UPS in Juneau and it was not positive."
3,"Honestly the capital city of Alaska would be better without UPS. Companies we order from would not use their service if they were aware of the hours of 7-8pm Mon-Fri. I will often call in my order and ask it be delivered Fed-Ex. I've had to track down the ups truck to receive a gift held for over a month. Feel sorry for the customer service agents they are in a no win situation they have always been helpful and kind.\n* positive update: My recent order was  4/4/17, I went to the UPS office and asked them to please hold for my pickup, the agent was great and gave me the local phone number and the hours their in the office 7-9am loading trucks for delivery. It worked they called when package arrived 4/7/17 and I was able to pickup before 9am. Not perfect by any means but a work around and was not turned over to USPS as I've heard can happen."
5,"Returns with prepaid UPS ground from Amazon totally work. I had an Amazon return and they took it no problem and the gal was efficient and courteous. Also interesting that as soon as the return was entered into the UPS system, Amazon issued the credit.  Yes, the hours are limiting however it is likely what they need to do to control costs with their limited presence here and it is likely timed around a particular flight. So, for these Amazon clothing purchases it works."
1,"All UPS has done is LIE about their failure to deliver our chemo meds.  They posted \""security check\"" in the tracking and left that there for 2 days.  On phone they told me TSA held the package for security-there was nothing they could do about it.  TSA reamed out the UPS Anchorage regional manager for that lie.  Found out one plane to Juneau was cancelled and that delayed everything but \""security check\"" is the note UPS makes whenever they delay a shipment.  Understandably a 0.5 oz bottle of 18 small pills couldn't fit on the plane.  Called asking what can I do to fix the problem.  One rep who could barely speak English said \""You can keep checking the tracking\""  as if that would do something to get the package shipped.  They also post FAKE time stamps on tracking notes.  I'd been calling and tracking all morning from 6-7:37am and getting worse and worse customer service people trying to convince me that 2nd day air really was acceptable to arrive in 1.5 WEEKS, maybe.  At 7:37am all of a sudden there was a note time stamped 6am that the package didn't make the flight.  They try to excuse that as \""we use standard notes and group everything together\"".  They had no answer when I asked why they didn't group everything together under an honest time stamp instead of faking an early one.   According to UPS that package of 18 small pills couldn't fit onto the flight.  Yes it really is pre-Thanksgiving that the busy delivery time, not Christmas too.  So now it will sit around all weekend in the Juneau warehouse where I MIGHT get it on Monday if I was lucky.  Forget that I paid for 2nd day air shipping.  It is CHEMO that UPS has delayed us from starting while cancer progresses and all they've done is LIE and act like we've been a nuisance trying to get the very legit chemo drugs that we ordered and paid extra for expedited shipping in good faith.  I truly wish every single person who has lied and delayed these drugs experiences someone in their family being gravely ill, waiting for potentially life savings medicine and that they get every delay and every lie they've given us to see what it really feels like.  Use USPS instead!!!"
4,It was open st scheduled time and gentleman was very helpful and courteous.     The only problem was a woman and then a man who were very rude interrupting what was being done for me three times.     The worker was patient with them but I couldn't believe anyone could be so rude.
3,"The store hours are very limited 9-10am and the drop-off box is too small for most boxed packages. However, if you do manage to make their open hours the staff is very friendly."
1,If this joke of a business can't operate with professional business hours instead of 7pm-8pm only
1,"The only UPS service area for 100\u2019s of miles serving over 30,000 people is open only from 7:00 pm to 8::00 pm M-F.  The one small drop box fills up early in the day. UPS service hours are pathetic, as is the size of the drop box.  Delivery service is wonderful, but in all other ways UPS is not serving the private sector adequately."
5,Warehouse location right behind main Juneau airport .. easy to find and staff very helpful.
1,"UPS is not cost effective when you consider the run-around and lack of local options. Since the item I ordered is only available on-line and they use UPS I had no choice here. The 800 # must be in another country, can't get a logical understandable answer. Been trying to track down the package for 2 days now, disgusted with them and will never order this product again, will let the company know why.. BTW, UPS in WA ruined over $3,000.00 dollars of home delivery RX (twice) ... insurance had to re-ship so apparently, UPS is not a good option in the lower 48 either~"
2,"WHY ARE YOU ONLY OPEN A COUPLE HOURS? The only reason you have two stars is because you have recently put out two drop-boxes instead of just the one. Unfortunately, the only time I ship with UPS is to return my college books which I send in a box that does not fit your drop box slot. Most of the time, the drop boxes are full to the brim and people could easily have their things stolen. Please get a larger drop box.\n\nI have nothing to say about the service considering I have never actually encountered anyone at UPS due to the terrible hours."
1,"4/19/2019 No they are NOT open three hours during the day, only two hours. (9 am to 11 am ) and then 1 hour at night ( 7 pm to 8 pm).  No weekend hours at all."
1,"interesting the question under \""write a review\"" would ask what did you like about it. the answer is nothing! I expected much more from UPS than to open to customers only one hour a day in Alaska's capital city. this is completely rediculous! so I will be shipping my item FedEx!"
1,Worst place ever. Go with a different shipping company. Open for one hour from 9-10pm when everyone is at work. Deliberately will not give out their phone number and makes it difficult to pick up your package. Also takes their time delivering. My package was in Juneau by 8
1,"Can't even begin to tell you how disappointed we are with this branch, particularly one employee who is of East Indian origin who goes by the name of Tinda we believe. Extremely disrespectful and has zero value for customers and very rude as well. The one and only employee of this branch who is a true professional is Dan, we absolutely love him. This man will go out of his way to make sure you are being helped and is the face of UPS. There is no such level of service in Juneau that Dan exhibits. We still do business with UPS is Because of Dan and the HQ should take notice. One star is for Tinda and 5 Stars for Dan!"
1,Poor service! Employee was rude and uninformative.
4,I have not dealt with any person with sending anything out beside my phone to get fixed. But I order my stuff through amazon and fedex has dented and left smashed boxes. UPS every package has been good no scratches or dents.
1,Hours closed by 11am every business day are ridiculous and nrcesitatesme taking my valuable leave off from work as I can not visit either during lunch or immediately after work.
1,Agree with other reviews.  I hate having to use them.  FedEx here in Juneau is much better.
5,Exelect service
1,"The absolute worst.  Local store is open 1 hour per day, 5 days a week.... maybe. Sometimes locked when supposed to be open.  One single dropbox outside, which is tiny and always full.  Local deliveries attemped x3 and then if you aren't home for signature, you have to pick up at the store. They don't alternate delivery times... try 3 times in a row at the same time of day, then hold your package hostage at the store because they aren't open during any hours people that work can go there.  Just horrible.  Note the same issues have been complained about in these reviews for FIVE YEARS RUNNING.  Unbelievable."
1,Website said my package left Anchorage at 9
3,The hours of operation for this business are inadequate for the amount of business that goes through its doors. At very least there should be more than two small drop boxes for packages to be left between business hours.
2,"My package was recieved as scheduled and the driver was polite and kind. But, everything else was headache. For starters, the office is only open for 1 hour-- what kind of BS is that for a shipping company in the state Capital? And they dont have their office's phone number avaliable anywhere-- its the customer service hotline. That of which, was not very good. And the dropboxes for people to drop items to be sent in are full to the point where stuff is falling out-- thats not safe at all! It might just be this one in particular because I've had many great experiences with UPS in the past, but as long I am in Juneau I will never deal with UPS again..."
1,"This place sucks. They are open one hour per day. At least now they are open for that one hour in the evening so you don't have to ditch work to drop a package but geez. Plus, the drop off box out front can only handle very small packages. How the heck do you send ups from juneau?"
1,"Arrived at 12:59 pm to drop off a package on my lunch break that already had a shipping label, just needed to be dropped off and the guy is standing outside because he locked up early and said sorry I can\u2019t help you."
1,"What the heck is with these stupid hours?  Wish they would close down UPS here in Juneau and stop anyone from sending packages using them.  They've had my package for more than 2 weeks now and didn't even try to tell me, then refused to deliver it.  They just don't care at all.  Very weak."
5,Superb staff and service. The only drawback is the one-hour-per-day office hour.
1,Awful customer service and limited times to drop off do not coincide with pickup times. Would not use this location unless absolutely necessary. Online and phone service are even less helpful.
1,The worst way to ship anything form or to Juneau.  Likely damaged and late.
2,"This office DOES NOT accept UPS Ground shipments.  That means ANY prepaid return label from ANY major internet site will NOT be accepted.  I've had to find workarounds multiple times because, although they'll deliver UPS Ground TO Juneau, they won't allow you to send items back the same way."
1,"The station is open one hour per day. That's the worst service I've ever seen.  If a pkg requires a signature upon delivery, and no one is home during the day, you have to take time off from work to drive across town to get it. Just don't miss the one-hour time slot.  I would never use UPS by choice."
1,"I try to use FedEx at all costs, the local UPS hours are ridiculous. It's got to the point the drop off bins are full with boxes piled on top that anyone could take, or reach-in and steal and that's every day."
2,"OK, so I needed to get in touch with the local office. The problem is that there's no posting of it in the phone book or online. Phone customer service from the 800 number is worthless. They can't even tell me the local phone number, but instead want me to jump through all of these other hoops (call the shipper and request an alternate drop off, create a MyUPS account and log in...). Overly complicated when all I want is to make a direct phone call."
1,If I could have given 0 stars I would have. EXTREMELY rude people that operate this business and very very confused delivery system. Will no longer order items that ship ups to this area. Horrible customer service.
1,"awful awful awful, please corporate take notice the black eye this branch is giving your company. Not just 1 experience, many botched"
1,"sucks in juneau. exspect long delays, no Customer service and a single drop box to serve the city. the closet sized store is only open 2 hours a day."
1,no customer service and closed saturdays what's the point of sending with ups at all anymore
1,They had my order in their warehouse for more than a month without attempting delivery or contacting me. That's a problem.
1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE EVER! DRIVER REFUSED TO DELIVER PACKAGE!! STATED HE WAS TOO BUSY
1,Doesn't even deserve a star. Worst customer service. Missing pieces to my package.They didn't think it was their fault. They have lost my packages multiple times as well.Most useless company ever.
1,"1 hour office hours 9 to 10,  full bin, only option per  UPS costumer service track down driver or pay pickup fee, costliest shipping Alaska, find random pigeon and hope it arrives at destination less inconvenient option"
5,Ups workers are really friendly
1,horrible

5,"As always, Escape Anchorage delivers. We did The Saloon and hand a great time collecting all the loot. The puzzles are great, the staff provides helpful clues when needed, and the overall atmosphere of the room was perfect. They even helped us out with a special request and hid a gift in one of the boxes."
5,So much fun! The rooms are well thought out and our team had an amazing time! We can't wait for the new room to be built! The owners are incredibly sweet and helpful as well. Hands down the best escape room experience in Alaska \ud83d\ude01
5,We had a great time! Will go again!
4,A good experience.
5,Actually it was the Fraternal Order of Eagles post #4174
5,Great family fun experience!! Great way to get out and stay safe
5,We had such a great time playing the Madhouse Funhouse! This was the first Escape Room that we played in the US and we loved every bit of it. 
3,Had an enjoyable time but it wasn't as fancy as other escape rooms I have been to.
5,"No reviews?! Well, I went to this escape room with a couple of friends and we had an awesome time! For two of us, it was our first escape room, but my other friend had been to many different ones in many different countries. Even with her prior experience, she really enjoyed her experience. One of the best parts about this place is the great lady who runs it. She talked with us before and after. She told us about how we solved puzzles and the different kind of minds who work in different ways. She correctly assessed that we had two teachers in the group and was surprised that we didn't know each other that well for the way that we worked together.\nAs for the room, without specifics, there were many different types of locks and puzzles. Prior to beginning she made sure to explain how different locks functioned so that our only challenge was the puzzle itself, not the mechanics of the lock. It was a comfortable shoes-off zone with carpet. There were lockers out front for your things.\n\nI really look forward to a Halloween revamp! Pleaseeee!\ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf83\u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7d"
5,"Super fun. We booked Dirty Harry as a date night and they have a slightly shorter version for just two people. It was super fun, made it with 7 minutes to spare!"
5,Went up into the mountains to play in the snow
5,Fun...went but had no desire to go and I'm glad I did.  It changed my view of it.  I had a good time.
5,"We had a really fun time solving the Dirty Harry escape room. It won't be around long, so if you've wanted to try it, do it soon before the rooms are retired for a new story."
5,This was a very fun experience!
5,"Great staff, creative and challenging rooms and puzzles, this place is fun. I've done two of the rooms they have and have had different experiences each time. The attention to detail is amazing and the work is all personally created by the owner. The rooms have incredible sets with clues hidden in plain sight and others hidden right under your nose but you don't notice them until some clue leads to another clue to another until it finally fits and tadaa a lock opens. I am looking forward to the next escape."
5,"This was my first visit to an escape room, and I went with a group of 12 (myself and 11 others) in the large room. It went fairly well, there was enough things for all of us to do something, and nothing was totally arbitrary. We did wind up being straight up given a few lock combinations, and pretty obvious hints (after a few related ones \""the person in the red hoodie has the map\"") where we were quite thick. Overall, I'd go back and do a different room, the puzzles were fun and all of us had a good time. For that large room, probably fewer could solve it, though it still works well with a large group, with none of us having done something similar before."
5,"Modest location, but amazing people running it. They are extremely helpful and you can tell they try their hardest to deliver the best customer service."
5,Enjoyed the escape room. Very fun and challenging experience. Very well organized with very friendly staff. Looking forward to coming back soon!!
5,Absolute blast! This is the escape room I brought my family to and I can't say enough good things about it. Lots of fun!
5,It was super well done. The puzzles were challenging but not frustrating.
5,Mindscape room was fantastic! Easily one of the best rooms I've done.
5,Great fun and team building experience for our family!
5,An absolute blast! The staff were friendly and helpful!

1,"The owner is extremely rude and wouldn\u2019t allow her employee to assist customers. We stood in line forever, when asking about an animal on premises due to being deathly allergic, she challenged it because she works in the medical field and has never heard of it. Only asked about the animal to be aware of it, not for special treatment. left frustrated and returned to show her evidence of my actual diagnosis and she told me to grow up, leave and was is calling the police. Uhhhh, why? So, I will be honest I could have acted better and not used the Fbomb or middle finger but I asked about a situation involving life and death and you challenged it. Hopefully no one does business with you at all. Especially with the way you treat people who have disabilities."

5,"I've been going here for about a decade now. Always a great experience. I used to hate the dentist (had a few traumatic experiences as a kid) & from the moment I first walked in I knew this was the place I'd stick with. Everyone from the front desk to the hygienists to the dentists are so kind, understanding, and actually care about you and your health. So much so that now that I live in the valley I am still willing to drive in to go there. 10/10 would recommend!"
5,"Every visit has been such a great experience! From the front office staff, to the Dentist to the hygienists, they all make up an amazing team. I\u2019ve had not so great experiences in the past with previous offices here in town and this office surpassed all of my expectations. From beginning to end, even through my current pregnancy everyone has made me feel comfortable and welcome. Highly recommend!"
5,"I\u2019ve been going to Peak Dentistry for a long, long time. It was known as Gentle Care Dental Clinic when  I started.  I love Monica and Jennifer. and everyone there. I\u2019ve never had a problem getting in to see a doctor when I needed one. I\u2019m glad Ben, the dentist is there also!  He\u2019s great!"
5,Lots and lots of experiences in dental offices.  Almost all positive.  Most great.  But this was the best.  Made the transition quick and easy from our longtime retiring dentist.  Thanks
5,"I've been through a few dentist since moving to the East side of town.  I've been trying to find a dentist that made me feel comfortable and was knowledgeable.  I also wanted a dentist who's main concern was my health and not making money.  Well, Peak Dentistry is my new home.\n\nThey were very thorough with their examination, taking a look at my teeth unlike any other dentist I've been to in my life.  The staff was very friendly, and the doctor was fabulous.  I knew I needed a lot of work on my teeth but have been given confusing plans by others.   I walked away from their office with an affordable game plan to get my teeth in top notch shape.\n\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96"
5,"This is the best dental office and Dentist that I have been to.  As my husband was military for 22 years we've been in several places and used local dentists every time.  Since moving here in 2001 we've been with Peak Health Dentistry at Gentle Care.  I highly recommend their service.  Always kind, friendly, and GENTLE!!!"
5,"I have been so happy with the service I have received over the years. Very competent, friendly, and helpful staff. I really appreciate their approach of ensuring your health comes first, and I have never gotten the sense that they are pushing any services that you don\u2019t need! The opposite in fact - they are down to earth and honest. Highly recommend!"
5,No schedule confusion. Every step taken to curb anxiety. Good dentist.

1,Don\u2019t come here. The dentist put a sealant over cavities that I had. I stopped coming to this practice because the people at the front desk gossip and are generally unprofessional. Going to a new dentist and found out that 5 of my sealants had to be replaced and one sealant was covering a cavity. I recommend going to the practice on the other side of the building if location is a concern.
5,"I\u2019ve been going here since 2008. Dan is my hygienist and super amazing. Dr. Just was my dentist (now retired) and Dr. Mishler is just as awesome. My mouth isn\u2019t hurting after, I am taught what I need to do more of and just happy to see all of them when I come in. Thank you for treating me so well. Have had very few cavities and one beautiful crown. Recommend if looking for a new dentist."

5,"All of the staff at Peak Health Dentistry are top notch! I've never been better taken care of by any other dental professionals as I have with Dr. Mishler and his dental assistant. (I wish I knew her name, because she's terrific, too!!) Every procedure was plainly explained (which I could understand!), and pain free (which is greatly appreciated!). Even during these trying times of social distancing and minimal staffing at many businesses, PHD got me in very quickly and took excellent care of me. I'll never venture to another dentist office!

5,"Really Great; I've been receiving dental care and cleanings from these folks since the mid 1980's. I've followed them from other practices to this current practice, Peak Health Dentistry. This dentist is the 2nd generation of the dentist I originally saw, I saw a new hygienist because mine retired after 30 yrs, and the front desk staff are warm and friendly. It's a very comfortable practice. I look forward to seeing them every time i visit."
5,"I avoided the dentist for many years and as a result, I've got a lot of work that needs to be done.

5,Love this place. I have the best hygienist and dentists in Anchorage. Office staff is super helpful.
5,Dan and Dr Mishler  were great!  I am one who is nervous going to the dentist. They made sure I was relaxed. I loved the warm neck wrap which helped. They explained my detailed treatment plan and answered all my questions. What a great team they have there including the front desk staff!

5,They are the very best!

5,"I\u2019ve been coming to this office since I was maybe about 11 years old (20+ years) and have never had a reason to look for a new dentist. My hygienists over the years have always been super friendly and thorough, and my current hygienist Dan is awesome. Does a great job and is funny too! Also side note - my last visit I had to take out my tongue piercing for X-rays and forgot to take it with me when I left. I called the next day and sure enough Dan had left it st the front desk in case I called. I thought that was so thoughtful! And even though I usually only see Dr. Just for a few minutes each visit, he\u2019s always pleasant and friendly, and I know I am in good hands. Would recommend to others without hesitation!"

5,"I love the people at Peak Health.  I have been their patient for over 20 years.  Even though I moved to Vegas last year, I still want to see them for my cleaning/exam every 3 months.

5,"The staff is always friendly, welcoming, and very professional.  I highly recommend this office for all aspects of dental care."
5,I had not been to a dentist in many years and experienced typical fears as a dental patient. I was very happy to come to a place like Peak Health where I felt welcomed by the staff and they respected my concerns as a patient. Tom was my dental hygienist and made my experience the best I\u2019ve ever had in a dental office. He took the time to explain everything he was going to do and the importance of it.\nDr. Mishler was also very reassuring when it came to my concerns. I couldn\u2019t be in better hands!
5,"Great experience for my first visit to Peak Health Dentistry today. I'm always nervous about cleanings due to tooth sensitivity, but Dan the hygienist was phenomenal about listening to my concerns, explaining anything I needed/wanted to know, and expressing empathy for my fears. Dan was also very careful throughout the visit to make sure it was as comfortable as possible, paying more attention to those details than any hygienist I've seen before. The consultation at the start of the visit (new patient) was far more comprehensive than what I've had elsewhere (Outside) and gave a clear impression that Peak Health cares about me as an individual patient. I only saw Dr. Mishler for about 5 minutes, which is a good thing because it means my teeth are healthy!, but he was also good and made sure to check if there was anything else I wanted to discuss. This place might even cure me of my dentist-dread after another visit or two!"
5,"This was my first time at Peak Health Dentistry and I was very impressed! The entire staff was incredibly professional, kind, and helpful! My hygienist was the best I have ever had. He explained the various cleanings and such and made me feel very comfortable. Because I mentioned that my sister referred me we both got a $25 credit. It was a Great experience!"
5,"Peak Health Dentistry has always provided me with exceptional care for the past 10 years.\nFrom Gwen & Jennifer (receptionists) who provide a warm, friendly atmosphere.\nto Dan (Hygienist) who not only cracks jokes (which is needed) but also takes his time to educate hard headed patients like myself about the importance of using the Water Pic\nand Dr. Just and Dr. Mishler are both friendly and provide excellent care. Thank you guys for all you do!"
5,This was our first visit and they were thorough and informative.

5,"Phenomenal crew. Always welcoming and willing to do anything they can to help you. They also work with each persons finances and offer payment plans through CareCredit. Ive been going there for the last 14+ years and wouldn\u2019t go anywhere else. Fillings, wisdom tooth extraction, cleanings you name it. They\u2019ve done not all and I\u2019ve never had any issues."
5,"I don\u2019t usually like going to the dentist, but the staff at Peak Health Dentistry are amazing! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a dentist, and even if you\u2019re not, I\u2019d recommend making the switch!"

5,Best place in Anchorage. Super friendly staff that makes you feel at home.
5,"Very comforting staff. Everyone was pleasant, updated me what was going to happen and what was happening. Took the time to talk with me and not just shuttle me through and off to the next patient. I\u2019m a very dentist evading person and was comfortable with Jae (sp?) and her pleasant smile and disposition and then Dr. Mishler who took every care to make sure I was comfortable and had no discomfort. Highly recommend this office."
5,"Love this place!! The staff here makes or family feel so comfortable. My sons have been visiting here since they were 2.

Your hygentist (Tom), and front desk staff are always welcoming, kind, and knowledge!   My 8 year-old daughter was amazed at how pleasant her experience was with getting a filling.

5,"Going to the dentist is not one of my favorite things.   Peak Health Dentistry  at Gentle Care is a warm , caring office to visit.  Everyone from the front office staff, dental assistants, hygentists and the doctor themselves, are very personable and genuinely care\nfor me. They always answer any questions I may have and make every visit as comfortable as possible.  I recommend them to everyone I know who needs dental care."
5,Twenty two years is how long we have been coming here. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere else. Amazing staff!  Practically like family at this point!
5,"They..\""Peak\""..are a good, professional outfit.  I wish I could say that about all my health care providers."
4,"I always have a great experience at Peak Health Dentistry. They create a bond with the patient, listen to any concerns or questions. They are great at reminding you of your upcoming appointments (call, text, and email) Oh I even got a Happy Birthday email from them! I have Monica has my hygienist and she is great! Very social, gentle on my teeth (lots of sensitivity)  and she makes me feel very relaxed. Some other things about the place is they give you sunglasses to help with the bright lights. They have a cool treasure chest full of goodies for kids that have no cavities, and I really like how they treat me as a patient and a person. I definitely recommend them :)"
5,What more can I say except that they are awesome! They are friendly and efficient. I was a late to my appointment because I had mistakenly thought it was at a different time but they still were able to work me in and did a fantastic job!   I have referred others there too and would happily refer anyone to Dr. Mishler and his staff!

They also offer the simple things that can make a visit to the dentists office easier like lip balm, movie glasses, and comfy chairs."
5,"Sometimes having a great hygienist makes a big difference in how comfortable and relaxing dental visits are, and Peak Health has some great ones. I\u2019m willing to drive farther to get to this location than I normally would just because it\u2019s such a better experience every 6 months. The dentists are good too - very thorough."
5,"What is most impressive about this office that I have not had at other places is they always ask how you are doing. They put chapstick on my lips so they don\u2019t get chapped, and they let you know what they will be doing next. Everyone is very welcoming."
5,"We've been customers for over 8 years now and love the doctors and the staff. From scheduling an appointment, to the visit, to even follow up calls, the staff is friendly and welcoming.

5,My hygienist Tom was very thorough and extremely helpful in educating me. And Jennifer was also very helpful in promptly getting my records sent over to my MD when I needed them. I appreciate their help very much!
5,"Hands down THE best dental experience I've ever had. Been a patient for several years and can't think of a single thing I'd change. I especially love the warm neck wrap and fuzzy blanket I get during my cleanings. Super thorough, appreciate the education following my visit, and the oral cancer screenings are an added bonus! Thank you Peak Health Dentistry. I'll keep referring my friends to you as well."
5,I decided to go to Peak because my husband and kids are seen here. So I figured it would be much more simple. I was very nervous to see a new dentist as I have had many horrible experiences in the past. I am SO glad I switched to Peak! They did everything they could to make my visit comfortable. They even offered things to help that haven't been offered at any other dentist that I have seen in the past. The staff here is very friendly and professional. My search for the perfect dentist is over and I know that the next time I go back I have nothing to worry about!
5,"I've been going to Gentle Care for almost 20 years, since I was a kid. I love the friendly and customer-service oriented staff, and Dr. Just has taken great care of my teeth over the years. It's always a pleasant experience visiting Dr. Just and his staff, even when I'm going in for not-so-pleasant procedures. They obviously care about their patients, which is a rare quality I think. I recommend them to all my friends and family! I mean, if Dr. Just is the team dentist for the Alaska Aces, I trust him with my teeth!"
5,Definitely was a relaxing and comfortable painless experience.    And this comes from a big baby when it comes to getting working done.   My comfort was their number one concern   Thank you

5,"It's the best care I've had in my 49+ years on earth.  Basically, Dr. Ben Mishler is my dentist, and he's at the cutting edge of dentistry, and an excellent communicator, a straight shooter.  Am really impressed with the staff, too, without exception.  They all are is super cool, friendly, upbeat, with a high-level of expertise, efficiency.  The practice seems to embrace technology.   So far, in my life, I've probably had 4-5 dentists, each spanning several years.  This practice feels the most like home, like it is where I want to be for quality, positive dental care."
5,Updated again! Brought my 5 year old with me the first time and we both received top notch care. Dan was FANTASTIC and super patient with my kiddo. Love these guys.\n\nUpdating my review! Still the best place to go fir dental care. They listen. To your anxieties and strive to make you as comfortable as possible!\n\n(Older review)Love this place.\nTom and Monica have provided me with FANTASTIC care and I love that they always talk me through the process. It helps me not feel anxious at all!
5,This dental office was very thorough and really nice people work there. I was really  taken aback when they asked if I wanted a hot towel for my neck. Will be going back for sure.
5,The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They are always checking on my comfort and very attentive to my needs.\nThanks ya'll!
5,"It was my son's first visit to the dentist.  He is three years old. This office was so fantastic.  Our hygienist was kind and friendly, explained and showed him what she was going to do, and made him feel comfortable.  She was able to accommodate for the fact that he didn't want to lay all the way back. The dentist was also really fantastic.  I am really grateful to have found this dental office.  Thank you.\n\nWe continue to use Peak Gentle Dental and love the personalized care they give or family.  The team always remembers, makes us as comfortable as possible and is as accommodating as possible.  We never sit and wait long to get in to see the dentist and actually always look forward to our visits."
5,"Love Dr. Ben and the staff and Peak Health Dentistry. I've never had a dentist's office call me before to tell me they were running behind schedule. Not having to wait around in their office and their consideration for my schedule was greatly appreciated. Dr. Ben explained my \""care plan\"" and Dan, my hygenist explained things to me about my teeth and gums that I never knew. Very informative, very professional...I highly recommend Peak Health Dentistry."
5,"I have been a patient here for 10 years, and I would not go anywhere else. The staff is so friendly and helpful, attentive and knowledgeable, and truly live up to the name \""Gentle Care.\"" I am offered a complimentary paraffin wax treatment for my hands during my cleanings, my jewelry is dropped in the sonic cleaner, and a warm lavender-scented blanket is available if it is chilly. The staff know my name, and remember what I was up to the last time they saw me. They are a charitable and giving group, both at work and in their free time. My teeth have never looked better and been so healthy, and my day is always better when I can start out with a visit to my dentist's office!"
5,I want to thank Monica again for such a wonderful job that she did with all 4 of my children today. She was a trooper to do all four in a row!  Our family has been at this practice for years and all the employees have been wonderful helping us with all our needs. I appreciate the care they take with my children to ensure they have a good experience.
5,This place is amazing. Kind and informative staff in an environment that is relaxed.
5,Peak Health is the only dentist I\u2019ve gone to in town and I have no intention leaving. Monica is the nicest and most down to earth hygienist I\u2019ve ever had and Dr. Mishler has been very informative about preventative care. I\u2019ll be coming back for years to come!
5,"I have been going here for over 3 years now.  I love how they make you feel welcomed when you first walk in the door.  The staff are very friendly.  I love how they explain to you what they are going to be doing to you before any cleaning. They take the time to let you know a better way to either floss, brush, etc..."
5,"Love, love, L.O.V.E the crew at Peak! We found Dr. Just shortly after we moved to Alaska almost 12 years ago. I was very particular about quality and wanted a great, faith-based dentist. The fact that he was the Alaska ACES team dentist also says  a lot! Of considerable note - I have had the SAME hygienists this whole time! There is very little staff turnover and I think that is rare in many medical offices. The team at Peak also spends time quarterly and yearly in training and conferences on the best and latest techniques. It's really great to know that NOTHING is antiquated at Peak! We regularly go and take our 4 children as well. The last time I took the children we were scheduled with multiple hygienists so we were IN and OUT in about 45 minutes! They also run a timely office and I don't think I have ever even had enough time to drink a cup of tea or coffee in the waiting room before being called back! This past year I asked if any of the hygienists would ever be open to speaking on dental health at my daughter's preschool and a team of two came out and did an awesome job with children! I feel like after all this time, not only are they excellent professionals that I TRUST and value with my family's dental health, but I now call them friends. OH - did I mention they do dental missions trips as well and have created a non-profit? So much to appreciate about their commitment to excellence, care for others, and giving back!"
5,Excellent service. Caring and understanding staff.
5,I truly love my hygienist Dan.. he\u2019s very professional and always courteous.. the front staff as well! I love that they always remember my name so I feel like family.. the Dentists are always very professional and right to the point which is why I go..
5,"I was really stressed out because of my chipped tooth, but when I walked in, Dr. Mishler was reassuring and put me at ease. He did an incredible job. I highly recommend this dentistry."
5,"I love this office, they are very friendly they can get my whole family in at the same time.  They work great with children of all ages. The staff is very nice and the Dentist does a great job. I would and do recommend to anyone."
5,Drs. Mishler and Just are awesome and I have had great experiences at Peak Health. I've had a crown and some fillings done as well as cleanings and they were all pain free and well done. They and their staff listened to my concerns and were honest and upfront with the options available. Thank you for your excellent work.
5,"Love, Love this place! I've always been terrified of the Dentists ever since young. Whenever I walk into Gentle Care, Gwynne always greets me with a smile and by my name. Tom, my Hygienist makes me feel really comfortable and distracts me by talking. Great Customer service and great place overall!"
5,"My family and I switched to Peak Health Dentistry about three years ago, and we've never been happier!\n\nPeak Health's dentists, hygienists, assistants and support staff are professional and friendly.  BY FAR, they are the most competent professionals in the dental industry.  We are very satisfied with their service and extremely glad we switched to them.  I don't have to drag my kids to the dentist because they love seeing them and they get the best dental care at Peak Heatth ."
5,"I just had my checkup + cleaning, and the service that I received was amazing. My Dr. explained everything that he was doing, made good conversation, and was super thorough. This was my first time coming here and I am very pleased with my service."
5,"Great dentist, great hygienists, great atmosphere. All the work I've had done here has been stellar. Definitely would recommend them to anyone."
5,"Amazing people, gentle hands, always a smile, and never have any issues when dealing with my teeth!"
5,"I went to see Dr. Mishler at Peak Health Dentistry a little over 1 week ago and got my wisdom teeth removed. I really enjoy dental offices NOW thanks to Dr. Mishler and his assistants! Dr. Mishler really cares about his patients and treats them with love, respect, and care. Thank you so much Peak Health Dentistry for the smooth, and easy tooth removal! :) I definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"
4,Great experience for our whole family. Comparably priced higher then other dentist we have visited but the my family loves the staff and the dentist.
5,"My experience here is awesome.  All the people are great especially Tom. Every time I visit the clinic for cleaning, etc. I feel like I don't wanna eat for a week just to let my teeth stay clean.\nI wish I could have brace someday but it's too much.\nThank you so much."
5,"Great customer service and very knowledge staff.  Dan, Dr. Just and Dr. Mishler have treated me for years with the utmost care and professionalism and I feel lucky to have found a place that knows me by name every time I show up and even when I call in! Thank you everyone at Peak Health Dentistry!"
5,"Our family invades the dentist twice a year and they are absolutely fantastic!  Highly recommended, especially if you suffer from dental anxiety."
5,"Monica is AMAZING at building trust and helping me relax before getting down to business.  Thorough and sensitive to my anxiety, I don't want to eat for hours afterward because my mouth feels so GOOD!  Yup, HIGHLY recommend them!!!"
5,Everyone and every experience has simply been AWESOME!! I had no choice but to schedule my daughter's appointment on her bday and they had a gift card to build a bear waiting when she arrived and was treated like absolute royalty during her visit. There is not 1 I would prefer to see when I schedule b/c EVERYONE IS SO AWESOME!
5,They have replaced 2 of my front caps in the last 6 years. These have been the best fitting caps I have had.  They did a great job matching the color. Ivwouls highly recommend this office.
5,I\u2019ve been going to Peak Health for years and years now. I love the employees and I\u2019ve grown a friendship with the staff. I\u2019ve never left hurting or upset. Highly recommend!
5,"This place is a dental unicorn. I've never met nicer, more authentic folks. They genuinely care, and while I had some major work done, it was pretty painless. We are fortunate to have them in Anchorage."
5,"Very personable people, from the front desk to hygienists to dentist."
5,Best dental office in Anchorage! If you\u2019re looking for an amazing hygienist and dentist. Definitely go see Monica and Dr. Mishler.
5,"Only been a patient here for a year now, but each time I've gone I've been so impressed by the kindness and positivity that the staff bring to their work.  They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable!"
4,"They have a very friendly staff that were very competent.  I love their system of being able to fill out paperwork online before you get there.  They print it out for you and all you have to do is sign it.  I saw a sign that said they do complimentary neck massage, have massage chairs, etc, but I wasn't offered any of that.  I certainly didn't need it though.  I had Dan as my hygienist and Dr. Mishler as my dentist.  Both were great and I had a very nice experience.  The front office staff have been very friendly and helpful as well.  Overall, definitely a place I would recommend."
5,My whole family goes to Peak Health Dentistry. They are great with kids and adults. Staff is very friendly and informative.
5,"2018 update:  Still extremely satisfied with our experiences here every time, all of the providers create a very professional and accommodating atmosphere.  They are always so patient with all of my kids, since we pretty much do everyone's cleanings on the same days (including my own).  Our kids love going to the dentist which says something about the level of service they provide, when you can get a 3, 5, 6, and 12 year old to sit still and get their teeth cleaned without much incident that is a huge positive. Keep up the great work!\n\nGreat place, very low stress for those that might not be too wild about dental work.  A lot of options for relaxing while getting work done.  Quick and professional services offered.  We switched the entire family over."
5,"Hands down the best dental office in town. Friendly and helpful front staff, hygienists and dentists!"
5,The staff are always friendly. Dr Just has a light hand when it comes to drilling. And they always try to make you as comfortable as possible.
5,"We have been clients of Dr just for 16 yrs and it has been wonderful! The staff is so positive, friendly and professional on every visit. They have been known to above and beyond the call of duty, on a couple of occasions they even bought my husband breakfast. PH Dentistry is the best in town hands down \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42"
5,"I've always been terrified of dentist's, however that all changed when I started working with Dr. Ben and Dan. Their entire team is impressive and very caring when it comes to my teeth needs, especially when it came to my first dentist visit in a long time. Their team also provided great educational tips to take a proactive approach in my oral health."
5,A very friendly experience from start to finish. The Tooth Man took excellent care of my teeth. I appreciate the time taken and attention to detail.
5,Love Gentle Care Dentistry (Peak Health Denistry) and have been going there for at least 15 years now. Dr Mark Just and Monica have been caring for me and and my family all these years and we just love the care we have recieved there. Wouldn't go anywhere else. Highly recommend Gentle Care to anyone looking for a Dental team.
5,My kids & I have always had GREAT service from Dr. Just\u2019s friendly staff. They know how to take care of their patients & make them comfortable.
5,Fantastic team!
5,I highly recommend Dr. Ben Mishler at Peak Health Dentistry. He always takes care of you and lays out the options with the recommendation for what is best for you in your specific situation regarding what is best for your health and what is best for you financially. I feel like I am family and that I fully trust everyone in this office.
5,"Every time I visit Dr. Mishler/Dr. Just's office, I am greeted as though an old friend. I stepped away for about 4 years because of finances. Their office was not pushy or nosy. They simply sent out cards to remind me they were there to help when I was ready. My first visit back, Gwynne the receptionist, didn't miss a beat. She knew me by name as if she had just seen me yesterday. Daniel Walker is one of the best dental hygienists there is. He is the main reason I came back to their office since I no longer live or work anywhere near. The dentists are wonderful but Daniel is very very gentle on your gums and teeth. He is not judgemental about your lack of brushing and will still encourage good behaviors.  I love the country music Fridays, the heated neck wraps, and the sun glasses to keep your eyes protected at all times!"
5,Always a great experience!
5,Always very thorough and caring about comfort. Many long time employees I'm always happy to see
5,Always great-Dan is awesome! We took our 3 year old for his first dentist visit and he loved it!
5,"Tom was amazing! He made me feel very relaxed, welcomed and appreciated.\nI totally recommend him."
5,"I cannot say enough great things about the staff! Friendly, knowledgeable, caring and great at what they do! Love them!"
5,I have been a patient with Peak Health since 2002.  Since being a patient I have had the best dental care.  My current technician Monica Douthit is wonderful.  The team at Peak Health go above and beyond to ensure that you receive the best customer service.
5,Everybody at Peak Health was professional courteous.  Very good job on the teeth cleaning.
5,"This office is amazing. They always go above and beyond and make sure I am taken care of, and their excellent service has even helped alleviate some of my anxiety about going to the dentist. You guys are seriously awesome!!"
5,"Professional, caring staff. The best dental practice I\u2019ve ever been to. I would highly recommend them to anyone without reservation."
5,They are very nice. They listen to your concerns and make you feel very relaxed. My wife was in pain and was seen within 3 hours of our phone call to them. They treat you right. I recommend them for all your dental treatments. You guys rock.
5,"Great staff,  they make dental torture feel humane!"
5,I\u2019ve been going to this dentist for years. The thing that keeps me coming back is that I feel very welcomed and comfortable knowing me by name after only my first visit. The Dr. is very gentle hints the name (gentle care) when it comes to numbing the area that needs work. They really make sure you are a Priority and really listens to what you wants and needs and will do what they can to work with you. I LOVE gentle care!!! I refuse to go anywhere else. They are like my 2nd family haha
5,The best dental experience I have ever had!!!  Dr. Mishler really cares. He comes across professional and knowledgeable without arrogance.  His staff is also friendly helpful and professional.  Tom is a great Hygienist.
5,Love this place. Been going here for years now. Always make time to fit me in.
5,"I've yet to have a bad experience. They are kind, through and gentle in their practice. They have really set the standard for good dentistry. I'm excited to take my daughter to them for her first dental appointment."
5,Have been a patient  here for 14 years! Great staff! They are like family!
5,"All the staff are friendly, polite and helpful. Patient care is excellent. It has always resulted in a good dental experience. This type of service should cure most fears of having to go to the dentist."
5,Monica was a fabulous and informative dental hygienist. I really appreciated how welcomed she made me felt as well as giving me detailed explanations to all my questions.
5,"Dr Ben Mishler at Peak Health Dentistry and Mrs Monica Douthit, Dental Hygienist, are both very professional and cordial. My experience was pleasant,  all my questions answered and I was given good information to continue taking care of my oral health . I recommend this clinic wholeheartedly."
5,"Top to bottom- this the place in Anchorage to have your shiny pearls take off.  I\u2019ve travelled the world-I come back to see Tom every time I\u2019m in town.  Michael, Scotland."
5,"Very professional, courteous, informative, and interactive across all levels of service.  I have been very pleased to make the change to Peak Health.  Drs. Just and Mishler have treated all 5 members of my family with the utmost professionalism, yet in a very friendly and comfortable atmosphere.  Frank discussions about oral health are common place not \""the exception.\""  If you want more from your dentist, do not hesitate to give them a call."
5,Been going here for over 10 years. Always great care and excellent admin folks.
5,"New crown - perfect fit, first time ever for that. Taylor is such a pro !"
5,"Such a sweet, caring staff! I found my forever dental office!"
5,I met Dr. Ben about six months ago.  He is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet!  Very professional. I recommend him every chance I get.
5,"Nicest professional staff, caring, efficient & thorough in their treatment!"
5,"I love the service I receive here, from the receptionist to Tom, the Hygienist, to Dr Mishler! I enjoy every visit. The location is also very convenient and close to post."
5,"As a military spouse, I have to find a new dentist every few years. For some reason, this is one of the most difficult of all my searches. I research, ask around, read reviews, and do my due diligence before I take the plunge. So when I choose, I only pick the best. After having had well over 17 dentists in my lifetime, I can say that this is definitely one of the finest among those 17 champions.\n\nMy experiences with Peak Health Dentistry over the past year (about 4-5 visits), have all been consistently positive and professional. From the moment you walk in, there is a serene and well-decorated, yet comfortable atmosphere. Gentle music plays in the background, but not the kind that makes you think they are overselling the calm. The atmosphere is truly one of peace and acceptance, almost Zen-like. I think it has more to do with the people than anything. They genuinely seem to love their jobs--there's real joy in the office. Everyone at the front desk greets you with a genuine smile and a warm \""hello, may we help you.\""\n\nThe hygienist, (I had Tom, aka Melvin Smirgley) greets you at the appointed time and escorts you to the room. Not only is he an outstanding hygienist, addressing all of my dental concerns, but he is professional, personable, has a great sense of humor, and is an excellent conversationalist and story-teller. He spends a few minutes getting to know you as he fills out the medical questionnaire. He genuinely listens and is really good at understanding you and your interests, which makes for the good conversation. He's quite versed in a wide-variety of topics. Combine that with his sense of humor and you get this very interesting guy who keeps you so engaged, that you forget about all the noise going on in your mouth.\n\nThe doctor, (I had Dr. Mishler) is equally as professional as all his staff. Internal joy and humor must be a requirement to work there because it is part of his character as well. He is the consummate professional, and has this personalized charm and compassion that puts you at ease, like he genuinely cares about you and your health.\n\nThe entire staff has an amazing way of making you feel welcomed and valued, without any preconceived ideas, agendas, or judgement. I highly recommend this business to anyone looking for a high level of professionalism, with top-notch customer service. They have created something special in this family environment. And to top it all off, they are big on giving back--check out their dental missions. When I was searching for a dentist, this was something that caught my eye as that \""X\"" factor to set them apart.\n\nI feel very blessed that I was lead to this office and will miss them dearly when I have to depart Anchorage. But for now, I look forward to all my future appointments. How many can say that about going to the dentist?"
5,Monica is a great hygienist. Staff are friendly and welcomng.
5,Always pleasant staff and atmosphere. Feels like family.
5,My whole family has been seeing Dr. Just for the last 11 years! No complaints. The staff is great with my kids...they actually look forward to their dentist appointments!
5,Great care! Great people! Great smiles!
5,A friend of mine referred me to Gentle Care. I have been very happy with my referral and I am so glad I asked her who she recommended for a dentist in the Anchorage area. Great professionalism and courteous throughout the whole visit.
5,Just went for my first cleaning and they were awesome!
5,They have the best staff and Monica is absolutely great!
5,"Service is nice and efficient, the hygienists are comfortable to talk to, and my teeth always come out clean."
5,"Great place, super staff. I had a emergency and they got me right in. I 've had to cancel multiple times on my cleaning due to work schedule and they have been great about that too.They have days that they are open till 7:00 pm which I just found out, looks like now I can keep those cleaning appts."
5,"2 years ago, my girlfriend dragged me kicking and screaming to Dr Just. He has an amazing staff. Whether Monika is cleaning your teeth, or Tiffany or Melissa are assisting Dr Just in your dental work, your experience will be nothing short of amazing. And if Dr Just needs to be fast, he can get your work done with speed and quality. I can't thank them enough for turning my smile around. Hadn't smiled in 10+ years. Now I smile all the time. A personal thanks to the Pixie (Jennifer) at their front desk for all of the financial help/planning for the last two years."
5,"Friendly and competent staff. Made going to the dentist a pleasant experience, would recommend this place to anyone needing a dentist."
3,"Just went in for a regular cleaning and checkup. Had to wait 15 minutes past the scheduled appointment time, and when I got home to see how everything looked I found that the backs of a few teeth seemed to have been completely missed. The staff are friendly though."
5,Such a great place to get dental work. I've had some really bad experiences before and the staff here does a fantasic job at easing your anxiety. They really care about how you feel and keep you informed.\nA+ to both Dr. Just and Dr. Mishler as well.
5,"Dr. Ben is a QUALITY person, with a heart for service to others. He truly cares and has the highest integrity. That is what I look for in my service providers. I know him personally and I know you and I can trust him!"
5,"Love the folks at Peak Dentistry. Dr. Mishler is fantastic. Where else can you go to get four fillings taken care of in one visit and they are so gentle and soothing, you realize you have started to doze during the procedure? (haha, but true story) I also trust them with the smiles and dental health of my whole family. My children love going to the dentist and my husband has had some complicated issues including implants they have managed with excellence and reassurance. So happy we have found them and more thrilled they can treat our whole family."
5,Everyone is so great. They work hard to ensure you're comfortable. I recommend everyone I can.
5,Always friendly and treat you like family.
5,"Our family has been going to Peak for well over 11 years now. Their team, service and attentiveness to care is why we continue to use them for our families dental care."
5,"We love PEAK! My husband and I bring our 3 children to Peak (and go ourselves as well)... Dr. Just and Dr. Mishler are soooo great with kids! My kids are never afraid and usually very excited! They love the little goody bag they get at the end of their visit (new toothbrush, toothpaste, flossers) and the prizes in the treasure box! We also LOVE Monica as our hygienist!"
5,Dr. Mishler was great! Very knowledgable and helpful in addressing my concerns and giving me the feedback I needed. The office staff is friendly and helpful as well and were great at following up with me when I needed some research done. I'd highly recommend them!
5,I started going to here a few years ago after my life long dentist retired.  Dr. Ben Mishler and team have been great.  Plan to keep going back every 6 months.
5,"Thorough, efficient and kind!"
5,Doc Mishler and his team have been wonderful. I had a few cavities and I was up and running with just a dull ache. I have Trigeminal Neuralgia and everyone there paid attention to my needs while working on my mouth. They recommend products to help me prevent the issue because they truly do not want to have to treat cavities. They want their patients to always have a great checkup. Prevention is key and I will now take the tools I have to keep up with their excellent cleaning job!
5,"Was visiting my daughter after the birth of my first grandchild. Developed a painful toothache.  My daughter suggested I visit Peak dental as she highly  recommended  them. Needed to have 2 teeth extracted. Was extremely nervous but the care I received was incredible, pre, post and during the procedure.  They even calmed my financial fears with payment plans I could afford , as I had no dental insurance.  When I travel to Anchorage again,will revisit to see if I can make them  my \"" part time \"". Dental facility, when in Alaska.  Yes, like the care so much ... Will travel!"
5,Every single person I\u2019ve ever dealt with at Peak has been nothing but kind and professional!  Dr Ben and Dan are just the best!
5,Jen and Monica are awesome!  Excellent customer service.
5,The people here make you feel comfortable and important.
5,"Staff is friendly, explains everything they\u2019re going to do to you, very professional. Definitely keeping them."
5,Dr Mishler and his staff were very professional and thorough. They took very good care of me and attended to my every need. I live in Las Vegas and I look forward to traveling back to Alaska for my 6 month check up! 
5,Been going to GentleCare for over 20 years and have always had great experiences. Would recommend to everyone!
5,I love the people there. So professional and personal.

5,Great staff. Doc was thorough and gave good explainations.
5,Peak Health Dentistry offers very clean and professional services. Love the warm neck wrap and the ability to watch movies while getting work done.
5,"This is the best dentist office ever! I've been going here for years. I have never had any complaints. Dr Todd and Dr Mishler have both worked on my teeth and have done an excellent job on helping me save teeth refusing to give up on them. My hygienists over the years have all been very special and extremely friendly. Monica is the best ever, we laugh so much even when she is cleaning my teeth. I wish I could get my teeth cleaned more just to laugh. Jen and Gwen always smiling and very helpful at the front desk, no matter how many times I ask them to change up my treatment plan. :) And to mention all the volunteer work the whole practice gives  (pays it forward) to the world.  If only the world could take a cue from them, we would be such an awesome world...LOVE YOU ALL...Diana Schmitz/Diana Dunham"
5,"Dr. Ben is one of the nicest people I know. His integrity, professionalism, and caring nature ensures you are in the right hands at Peak Health Dentistry."
5,Insantly felt the freindly atmosphere. Very easy to talk to. Thanks!!!!!-
5,This is the absolute best dentist I\u2019ve ever been to. I will be so sad to move out of state because I know I\u2019ll never find a place as good as this one.
5,Been coming here for awhile now. Customer service and the services they provide are always great from the front desk to the Dentists I\u2019ve always had a good experience.
5,"The best office staff, my favorite hygienist in the world, and great dentists. What\u2019s not to love?!"
5,Friendly staff and  positive vibe with Great atmosphere. I\u2019ve been a patient for 10 years now.

5,"I had arrived in Anchorage for job. I was in a lot of pain and dismay due to a botched dental implant job by a dentist in the lower 48. I was afraid to see I was afraid to see another dentist however, due to the pain and discomfort I had to do something. I was seeking help to convert the implants to snap on instead of the ones that screwed on. The procedure I had by the dentist in the lower 48 was erroneous he removed all my teeth that did not have to be removed and did an all on 4 dental procedure where the dentures screwed into the implant and could not be removed unless a dentist removed them. As a results my gums became infected and painful and I was unable to clean them. So, after I moved to Anchorage I decided I needed to see if I could find a dentist to help me and I did not want to see a dentist who would put me through what I had already gone through. I went to see a local dentist and he drew some lines on a piece of paper and said he could convert the implants gave me an estimate, and overcharged me. He was very detached and only about the money.\nNeedless to I was very disillusioned and did not return to this dentist. I keep passing the Peak Health Dentist office and saw some of the advertisements and decided to look it up and I did and I then made an appointment for a free consultation.\nI was very impressed with the staff and their receptiveness and concern. This is when I met Dr. Ben Mishler. I explained what I had been through and what I was trying to have done because I could not continue down this path. Dr. Mishler listened to every word I said did some x-rays and consulted with me about the different options that were available for me. I knew this would be difficult trying to correct someone else\u2019s work and change the implant system that was already there to something that was functional. So, I agreed on a plan and he laid it out and we started our journey. I had anticipated a 2-3 month process however, when he removed the dentures the tissue was so bad that he had to treat the gums and allow them to heal before we could do the procedure. He adjusted the dentures from the old dentist so that I could clean the implants and allow the gums to heal. He showed compassion and care which a welcome was. He checked on me regularly and provided support through this whole process.  The end result was healed gums and the placement of an implant system that I could care for easily. Dr. Mishler is the best dentist in the world. Since I was a child I have been afraid of dentist and have extreme anxiety when seeing a dentist but Dr. Mishler worked with me and helped me through it all with patience and care that I had never experienced from any health care provider before especially a dentist. I had to recently relocate to another state but will fly back just have dental care and checkups from Dr. Mishler. I encourage anyone who has any dental issues to see Dr. Mishler. He is an exceptional dentist and human being and he surrounds himself with staff that hold the same belief about care and patients."
5,Love Peak Health for our family.  Great staff!
5,"Friendly, honest, and great with kids. The bald guy rocks!"
5,Outstanding service.  The family always look forward to the next visit!
1,Worst customer service at any Health clinic I've been to. Never have I had a provider cancel an appointment before. The dental clinic cancelled my appointment AFTER I traveled to Anchorage from a village to get my tooth worked on (which they knew about) Money out of pocket WASTED. Unless you want to deal with the possibility of having your appointment canceled do not come here. (Plus the ladies were rude and unapologetic)
5,"Clean, great music, hi-tech, great employees!"
5,Always impressed with the staff.
5,The People are kind and Answer your question so that you can understand how it works and no game playing Which is nice will be going back forever

1,"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever received in my life. I went to try on scrubs before ordering them for work and as soon as the lady realized that I will not be purchasing scrubs here she immediately changed her tone to \""yup, nope I sure don't carry any of those styles\"". This statement was given even with showing her four different basic styles, and half the store is the brand that I was looking for. She wasn't willing to even show me something that would be a close fit.  This employee should not work in customer service with her errigant attitude. If your too good for helping a customer then maybe you need to rethink your life choices."
5,It was a great store winning on their final days. I just think it was in a bad location they're closed now. December 23rd 2017 is when they closed.
1,"Poor selection, minimal inventory in any size BUT xs and 2x. Unhelpful staff, didn't want to answer questions and that little dog in there is nasty. I wasn't warned it was mean, so when I reached down to pet the thing as it was sniffing my leg, it tried to bite me. The staff? She said, \""oh ya she's not always friendly\"" no kidding"

5,They had what I needed on a short notice.

5,"Karlesa was incredibly helpful. Being a first time home buyer, I don't have a lot of knowledge of the process. She was patient with me and took the time to explain and answer all my questions. I put my trust in her and she did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend her/this agency to anyone looking for a real estate agent."
5,"Janice Loubaugh is a breathe of fresh air in the real estate sector. I sold a lot, and more recently, my house using her as my agent. Prior to this she helped my daughter in a real estate transaction. She has a wealth of knowledge and puts her experience to work. She always keeps her clients first and foremost. I can't say enough good things. 5 stars is not enough!"
5,Janice and Karlesa were fantastic to work with and we would recommend them to anyone! They were great at getting us into view houses quickly (most of the time the same day they went on the market) which is essential in a fast paced market like today. We appreciated their honest opinions on houses and that they truly were looking to find the best fit for us and not just make a sale. They made the process as smooth and easy as it could be for first time home buyers and we are so happy we choose to work with them!
5,"I worked with Jessica Baker and had a really smooth buying experience, even with being out of state and handling everything remotely we were able to close early!"
5,Janice & Karlesa Lobaugh with Alaska Premier Group at hands down the best realtors out there! With many years experience they will not lead you wrong! Nor will they let others lead you wrong! The most helpful ladies ! We couldn\u2019t have done it without them! Now we get to enjoy such a beautiful home !
5,"Dear Janice,\n\nI appreciate all your help in selling our home. Your marketing strategies, negotiation skills, and attention to detail ensured the process was smooth and win-win one for us, we could not be happier we chose you to list our property.\nEven more impressive was your ability to think outside the box and reveal strategies that met the challenges that emerged in the unique counter offers we had and your solutions to them. It truly opened my eyes compared to previous experiences of paper pushers vs your dedication to honing your profession and skillsets.\n\nYou are a Great realtor and represent the community and the State of Alaska very well.\n\nThank you again for your hard work and expertise. You\u2019re second to none!\n\nTom Wilson\nFormer Overall Mr. Alaska\n2-time NPC USA Championship Finalist\nAlaska Bodybuilding Hall of fame Inductee"
5,"We are moving from out of state during a difficult and busy time for real estate in AK and Cindy was so personable and sweet to help guide us in the right direction.  Cindy was extremely professional, kind and responsive to our needs and will definitely be reaching out to her when we decide to buy!  Thank you Cindy!! :)"
5,"Janice Lobaugh is the real deal folks! After being greatly disappointed with a local realtor we went on a hunt to find the best agent in Alaska.  The reviews don\u2019t lie; Janice is impeccable and she will sell your home!  Expectations were set in the beginning and followed through to the end.  She was always upfront, communicated every transaction immediately, and worked around the clock until we recorded.  Her excellent negotiation skills sold our home for more than asking price.  We are thankful for finding Ms Lobaugh and highly recommend her!"
5,"We were looking for a house in Wasilla, Alaska while we still living in Oregon. Janice is a very nice person and a very professional agent, she would go out of her way to help her clients to have their dream coming true. Janice had tried her best to help us to secure our interest. We are very happy with our purchase and appreciate her help. Thank you Janice to help us to have our Alaska dream coming true."
5,"We had to sell our house on very short notice, and it needed to sell quickly (which it did). Janice and her team were Amazing!! This was our first time selling a house and Janice was more then happy to explain every step to us, so we knew exactly what was going on and what to expect. I can't explain how grateful I am to Janice and her team. I will be (and have been) recommending her to anyone I know looking to sell their house. When we move back to Alaska I know I will be going to Janice to help us buy our new home."
5,"After researching a number of agents, we ultimately chose Janice based on her reputation.  We knew selling our home in a buyers\u2019 market could be challenging, especially when we were already living 4,500 away from Palmer.  When COVID-19 hit just days before our house was scheduled to be listed, we were worried, to say the least.  Janice put together an incredible marketing package that brought us two full price offers within a day of listing.   As the sale progressed, we ran into several unforeseen issues that jeopardized the sale.  Janice became our rock as she skillfully offered straightforward advice, which allowed us to make sound decisions that kept the sale on track.  Janice did everything she promised and more.  We\u2019re happy we choose Janice as our Realtor and we highly recommend her to you."
5,Janice did an excellent job helping get my house sold in a quick manner. She helped me get the price I was looking for and was helpful and professional. I would work with her again any day.
5,"We are recently new homeowners thanks to Janice Lobaugh and the Alaska Premier Group! We cant speak highly enough about this Real Estate team. They are extremely helpful and honest when showing you properties. Not only did She find us plenty of properties to look at but helped us weed out the ones that weren't right for us. They are very knowledgeable about previous owners and if you have any questions or concerns about a property they get to the bottom of the issue within a day or so. We would strongly recommend Alaska Premier Group to anyone who is buying or selling a home.\nMany thanks to Janice and her team! We honestly couldn't have found such an amazing house and deal without your expertise. You guys truly rock!\nThanks so much,\nThe Costanti's"
5,We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better realtor! Miriam truly went above and beyond to help us find a home we loved and could afford. She was responsive to all of our many questions and literally worked around the clock to make sure everything went smoothly. We had the perfect home buying experience with Miriam as our guide.
5,"We met Janice in 2019 after a bad experience with a different reality company trying to sell our house.  Our previous reality company had no useful input or guidance when we entered the market, as a result we entered the market overpriced and generated very little interest. After several months of price lowering and no showings, we fired the realtor.\nJanice had a no-nonsense approach; she quickly conducted a market analysis to give us an idea of a price range for the current market. We relisted our house and Janice pushed advertisement out to highlight our property in the market place. It was late in the year and we had missed the prime part of the house selling season, as the market dried up and an offer did come in December 2019. Over the next several months the buyer repeatedly missed deadlines and was granted extensions. After 3 months the buyer was unable to secure financing and the deal fell through. Janice was a professional and provided the assistance needed to relist our property in a way to enter the spring market where we would be positioned to sell in a reasonable time. Janice promoted our property within her real estate network and showings started very quickly. It did not take long and multiple offers were received.  After reviewing the offers we made a counter offer which was accepted and we were under contract once more.  This time every step of the process went smoothly. Janice, and her team, were on top of all the paperwork and milestones that needed to happen. Janice was able to alleviate our concerns, when they arose, as the selling process progressed. At times emotions were intense, especially after the experience during the winter that fell through. Janice stuck with us throughout the entire process, she was professional and understood our concerns. Yes we recommend Janice and her team to help navigate the house selling process."
5,"I absolutely had to write a review for this company. Janice was so spectacular for us from start to finish. We wanted to purchase a home in what was probably an unrealistically quick time frame, and Janice relentlessly tackled the task for us, making sure that we found the home that we desired for the price we wanted and in the time that we needed. We were constantly pleasantly surprised at how hard she worked and how much she cared. She was on the ball 24-7 for us throughout the entire process. Professional, communicative, just perfect. If you desire a realtor that will work hard for you and that genuinely cares, then call Janice at Century 21 today, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed."
5,"If you are heading to Alaska, the Great Last Frontier, then look no further than MIRIAM GUIDO at Century 21, w/Alaska Premier Group!\nMiriam was, and continues to be, an 11 out of 1-10!!!  She made the purchase on my Alaska property painless and even enjoyable.\nOver the last 3 + months, Miriam was:\nquick to answer my NUMEROUS questions, always looked out for the most efficient and helpful route in the \u201cpaper nightmare\u201d when buying property in Alaska when you live 3,000 miles away in Oregon!  She never faultered in staying in touch - whether by phone, text, or email.  Throughout the entire transaction, Miriam always remained a true professional realtor of the highest caliber!\nShe always maintained a positive and upbeat attitude...regardless of the many challenges we faced in the laborious process of buying property with so many miles between us...\n\nIn my eyes, Miriam Guido is a true PROFESSIONAL.\nWhen you work with Miriam, it is like working with a family member...\nI am proud to call her a beloved confidant and FRIEND!\nTHANK YOU MIRIAM GUIDO!\nYou made my life\u2019s dream come true...\n\n~Liz Fox~"
5,"Janice and her team are class acts. Janice is a wonderful person and a joy to work with. Her professionalism is top notch. She was the only real estate agent to come with her homework done, she means business and had her act together! She knows you are the customer and treats you right all while making sure you understand the process and are educated. She looks out for her clients and is able to think outside the box when necessary. She is diligent, persistent and very open with communication.  I highly recommend her when buying and selling! My house had an offer in under 11 days and successfully closed in under 6 weeks. She also helped secure the home of our dreams, which was quite the rollercoaster. She is a wonderful partner to have by your side, if you are in the market to buy or sell. Highly recommended!"
5,"I first contacted Janice Lobaugh back in 2013 and her no nonsense approach toward real estate left a lasting impression. Six years later I reached out again and she remembered our situation and helped us sell our property.  If/when we return back to Alaska, Janice will be who I deal with!"
5,"It was a pleasure working with Janice. We live out of state and she made the process of selling our land seamless. She is a professional that puts in the effort, is quick to respond to questions,  easy to get hold of and updated us throughout the process."
5,"Wow! All I can say is Janice is a phenomenal leader! Everything she does is with class, happiness, knowledge and expertise! Every event she has is a success and she includes the WHOLE community not just a chosen few. What an amazing individual and well run business! Its not just an appearance ( office is beautiful) - its like 'going home' !!! Comfortable, refreshing, welcoming and informative! This is the place you want to be for all your realty needs."
5,"I have known Janice for years, she has always been the person to go above and beyond to help out. She worked with me for quite some time in my home purchase process. I called her constantly with questions, and she always was there to help. She helped make this process much less stressful, I would definitely recommend her\nover and over to everyone buying or selling a home. She will be the person helping me on my next purchase. I personally believe she's best in the business. Janice will stick with you from the beginning to the end and then some."
5,I was referred to Janice from a good friend of mine. She is a great person to deal with and is very knowledgeable. She is very thorough on letting you know all the information that you need to know before buying a House. She's is very straight forward and wont feed you a line of bull. She's very dedicated to what she does and treats you like your family. She made my first time buying a home a breeze and explained everything I needed to know before we proceeded in every step of the home buying process. I definitely recommend her if your looking for a home and need some one to stand by you and she makes sure your well taking care of.\nThanks Janice
5,"5 years ago, I reached out to Janice for advice on becoming a Real Estate Agent. Without even knowing me, she set aside an hour of her day to give me a run down of the basics. She was so honest and up front about everything. Last year I decided to get my license and become an agent, but I had a friend in the industry, so I joined his team. I was having a really hard time getting any people to come look at a property that I had listed for sale and I thought I would drop by Janice\u2019s office to introduce myself and ask her advice. She again opened her door to me and gave me a LOT of advice. She allowed me to sit with her for the day to see how they operated in her office. Within minutes of being in her office, I knew I belonged on her team. This team knows how to get things done the right way, and for the right reasons! They care about their clients and know that this is sometimes the biggest purchase of the client\u2019s life. I joined the team and was welcomed with open arms by everyone in the office! They are all there to help each other. I have learned more in the 3 months in this office than I have learned this entire year! Janice has a huge heart, and cares about her team and her clients. It is a warm family environment, that operates ethically and honestly. I sold the listing that I stopped in to ask questions about within 1 month of having it listed with Janice\u2019s office.  Janice knows the industry very well and knows ways to get things done efficiently!!"
5,I highly recommend Janice and her team at Alaska Premier Real Estate and I was very happy with the results they produced for me.\nAfter having my house listed before through another office for 6 months I did not have 1 offer. Janice and her team were upbeat and positive from the very first time I contacted them and they had an offer for me within the first week of having it on the market. I was able to get exactly what I needed and was very pleased with their professionalism and attention to the details. I would not hesitate to use Alaska Premier Real Estate for any of my future real estate needs.
5,I am really impressed by Janice and her warmth and caring about helping others in the search for a domain that fits the client and the needs of the future!  She looks for that right fit and is a natural at making you feel at home in the right home!  I plan on using Janice anytime I need and investment property or a personal castle!  I am confident that she will always fit the bill!  Thank you Janice for making my experience pleasant and fulfilling!
5,"To everyone looking for the BEST in Alaska look no further than Alaska Premier Real Estate!!! We couldn't have asked for better customer service, a business relationship, or most important integrity minded people!!! They far succeeded in our minds the kind of real estate company you want behind you,  when dealing with builders and other real estate agents!!! We not only gained a beautiful home but lasting life long friends!!! Thank you for everything!!! Would recommend you anytime of the day!!!"
5,Janice was a rock star with selling our house! She was always on top of everything and really fought for what was best for us when we ran into some difficulties. The wealth of knowledge she provided is unbeatable.
5,"Throughout my most recent purchase, Janice Lobaugh of Alaska Premier Real Estate helped my family deal with a difficult purchase.  She was extremely responsive to our communications and helped answer all of our questions/concerns.  If she didn't know the answer she would often get back to me that same night with the answers.  That being said she is extremely knowledgeable, ethical, and market savvy.  I highly recommend Janice and her team at Alaska Premier Real Estate and will continue to use them for my real estate purchasing/selling needs."
5,"Janice Lobaugh is one terrific professional realtor. Thank you so much for helping with this sale. She is one dedicated individual and will work for you, in any way she is able to get the job done. Thank you so much."
5,"To be told that the home you have rented for seven years is being put on the market and you have two months to move is a very stressful situation, but for my husband and I it turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to us. Janice Lobaugh came in to our lives and (spoiler alert) we are now first time home owners! Janice and her team (especially Joe Clawson) were so helpful and went above and beyond for us. She not only promptly answered every question we had (many), but also answered questions we didn't even know we needed to ask and we always felt that she had our best interest at heart. Janice is professional, honest, and works hard for her clients. When things became difficult during the buying process my confidence in her never faltered (she is an amazing negotiator). We have been in our new house for just over two weeks now and she contacted me today - she is still working for us! Wow! Janice is definitely my realtor for life and I will recommend her to everyone I know."
5,We used a property management company for 8 years with our Wasilla home.  Within the first 8 minutes I knew Janice Lobaugh was for us. She worked very hard and diligently to get our home prepped for the market so it wouldn\u2019t sit long. We are almost to the finish line and I couldn\u2019t thank Janice enough for helping our family minimize the stress of selling a home while being so far away.
5,Janice and her crew sold out home in Wasilla in under 24 hours.  This is the third home that Alaska Premier Real Estate has represented us as either buyers or sellers.  Straight forward professional service at all levels.  Impeccable integrity combined with an outstanding sense of urgency sets Janice and her team apart.  Going the extra mile to serve her clients is not going out of the way for Alaska Premier Real Estate - it's just what they do.
5,Janice and her group of people always strive to make \u201cYOU\u201d their priority!\n\nThru the years when I have a question or something comes up... they are GREAT about explaining everything and going the extra mile without hesitation!\n\nI usually don\u2019t take the time to do reviews... but giving credit when credit is due is something I believe in.\n\nI have and will continue to recommend Janice & her amazing team when buying or selling a property.\n\nThank you & God Bless
5,"The broker of this company is probably the most knowledgeable in the business. I worked with realtor Miriam Guido and she and I looked at many homes together but none were right. She found a builder for me that was able to get me in a new home within my limited budget.\n\nMiriam isnt just my realtor, we became  friends through the process. While Alaska Premier is very professional, they have a way of making you feel like family."
5,Janice & her team have been absolutely AMAZING! She answers every question I have and always makes time for me and my concerns. I feel that I have someone protecting my best interests for me and my family during this stressful time of selling and buying our homes. She gives 110% in everything she does and it shows. Thank you Janice for everything you have done and continue to do.
5,"Janice Lobaugh was the agent selling the home, she was very informative and helpful while making us feel very comfortable with her and her company. The experience was like working with an old friend.  Janice kept us informed regarding every step of the process so we always knew what was happening and what the next step would be."
5,"My late husband and I lived in Atlanta GA,  he being a small aircraft pilot had a dream of retiring in Alaska!\n\nWe met the crew at Alaska Premier Real Estate and off we went\u2026Janice gave us\nvery personable treatment!\n\nEven though he was killed before we found our dream home I know Janice would have found it because she got to know us and what we were looking for!\n\nThanks again Janice !!!"
5,"I have been pet/house sitting for Renee Foley since 2012 and have gotten to know and love her very much! She is a woman of integrity and she would not work for a company that didn't fit her ;) She is very outgoing and protective of those she takes under her wing, or in her den. She's a mamma grizzly for sure and she's got the knowledge,drive, passion and ambition to do all she can for clients, friends and family alike!\nLove You Renee!"
5,"Talked with Janice for about 2 years about plans to sell our house and upgrade. Finally made it happen and I can\u2019t say enough about how easy the process was. She never pressured me along the way, was always looking out for my best interest, and best of all....had an offer on my house within one week!! Highly recommend!"
5,"We have sold & bought a home with Alaska Premier Realestate and they have exceeded our expectations both times. The building of our new home was not without challenges from the builder & his team , some of which made us question our decision. If it wasn't for Janice & her team handling these concerns with professionalism & assuring us they have it handled we would've of walked away. Janice and her team will go above and beyond and gets the job done. You will gain a forever realtor & friend with this group of people."
5,"I had kept the handwritten postcard from last summer that read, \""We are not a big box real estate agency...\"".\n\nRecently, I took out that postcard, read it again and called Alaska Premier Real Estate. Shortly after that, Janice and Sean were at my home during a snowstorm to start their marketing analysis. Their words were congruent with the postcard. Janice explained my rights, answered my questions and gave me \""homework\"".\n\nJanice did two sets of comps to more accurately market my home.  When I asked her to clone herself and find a home for me back East, she searched the internet, did some phone interviews and located a realtor for me who she felt would do a good job.  I am now working with this realtor and viewing new MLS homes each day.\n\nI am so grateful for all of Janice's efforts.  She is always available, she's not pushy or aggressive, she cares about her clients, and delivers on her commitments. I believe she says, \""Do right by the client and the money will follow\"".\n\nIn 40 years of buying/selling real estate, I haven't met another realtor who could hold a candle to her.\n\nThank you, Janice, for demonstrating that buying/selling a home doesn't have to be stressful!"
5,Janice was amazing!  Within 24 hours of placing my property on the market offers were made and the property was sold within days!  Addition Janice was able sale the property well over the listed price. This same property was on the market for three month previously with another realtor and received no offers.  I would highly recommend Janice and Alaska Premier Real Estate!
5,"I have known Janice for over 40 years and when it came time to purchasing a property, after seeing her devotion and successes in Real Estate, I knew I would ultimately utilize her services.\n\nEven though she lives in Wasilla, she was able to find me a suitable home and she sold it to me from afar! There were many things that I did not understand, as this is my first home and between Janice and our daughter, I was able to make a good decision and purchase a home that was suitable for my budget.\n\nIf you are in the market for a new home, anywhere in the State of Alaska, I would recommend you contact Janice Lobaugh. She has been affiliated with the real estate industry for over 25 years and has devoted her time into learning her career."
5,"Janice and Nikki are fantastic, hands down!! As a first time homebuyer I had NO clue what I was doing, and they walked me through each step of the process and explained everything to a T. I never had to question what I was walking into because they were so informative at every turn. When I found myself having \u201ccold feet,\u201d Janice reassured me each step of the way and provided me with the support I needed. I could not be more pleased with the services I was provided. I am officially in my new home as of 6 days ago and I couldn\u2019t be happier!!"
5,"Janice and Miriam worked very hard to get the home we wanted, constant negotiations and encouragement.  My husband and I felt like we mattered and not just a number.  They were both amazing to work with and hoping to find that perfect home in the next year with this team!"
5,"Janice and crew were simply Awesome!!\nVery professional, high quality marketing and to the point communication was the key to our successful and quicker than average sale of our custom home in Palmer Alaska.\nJanice made a very emotional and stressful time a lot easier.  She took the time to listen and respond.  With out hesitation we would highly recommend Alaska Premier Real Estate.\n\nThank you Janice, for Everything you did for us."
5,"Janice and her team at Alaska Premier Real Estate went above and beyond when helping me with my real estate transaction as a first time home buyer. Janice and her team helped me through every step of the process, from the search for my family's perfect home to closing the transaction with keys to the house in hand. I would (and have!) recommend Alaska Premier Real Estate when it comes to your Real Estate needs."
5,"Janice assisted me in buying and selling my first home in Juneau several years ago before she moved to Wasilla and started her business there. She is one of the most knowledgeable, professional and consistent person I have met over the years. She will give 100+% of her skills in real estate to you at any time. So if you need an outstanding Professional Real Estate person and Associates to help you find your new home or are wanting to sell your home, give her a call.  She is awesome!"
5,I moved out of state and needed to sell my property quickly.  Janice made it quick and easy.  She worked hard around the clock and was very accommodating.
5,"When we bought our first home Janice was our realtor.  She put a great deal of time and effort into finding the perfect home for us and we are still very happy with our choice.  Janice found the best home in our price range before it was even listed.  I appreciate her commitment to her clients and would highly recommend her as the person to help you sell or purchase a home.  Thank you, Janice!"
5,"When my husband and I purchased our first home we went to my sister Janice Lobaugh, Broker/Owner of Alaska Premier Real Estate. Knowing she has many years of experience with Real Estate and we wouldn't be given the run around or passed off to someone else. Janice had educated us with the home buying process and shared her knowledge and experience with us. Alaska Premier Real Estate is unlike any other Brokerage always willing to help! Thank you!"
5,"After nine months of inactivity with another agent, we contacted Janice Lobaugh. Janice brought vast experience, suggesting the initial selling price based on the market. Janice was very proactive with communications as well as coordinating with various third parties needed to complete the sale. Janice was a pleasure to work with and we would not hesitate to use her services in the future. MAHALO TO JANICE AND HER TEAM!!"
5,"Janice and Miriam are unreal awesome. They made us feel comfortable the whole way and never made us feel presured in any way. Which was very important to us. When things got complex, they made it happen. Thank you so much for everything."
5,"Janice was one of the most driven agents I have worked with. I highly recommend her. Her approach was very straightforward, she always showed results, and she got us what we wanted. Simple as that!"
5,"We highly recommend Alaska Premier Real Estate! Our agent, Jenny Rath, was the best real estate agent we have ever had the pleasure to do business with! We give 5 stars for their professionalism, their integrity, and their excellent service. We found our dream property, and thanks to Jenny, Janice, and the Alaska Premier Real Estate team, we enjoyed a flawless transaction."
5,"Janice Lobaugh is: Tenacious. High Energy. Professional. Highly Informed. She took on a very difficult sale when others walked away, and believe me, it matters when someone is honest, caring and willing to work their heart out for you when all seems lost. I can never praise her enough! You can't go wrong with Janice and her great team!"
5,"I had an awesome experience! They were all so nice and friendly! Always helpful, knowledgeable. The only office I'll call with my Real Estate needs!"
5,We had a unique piece of property that Janice marketed as residential and commercial. We were able to find the right buyer and had a mostly trouble free closing. Thanks Janice and your Alaska Premier Real Estate team!
5,"Janice sold Us our first home in 2006 and we have been friends ever since.  She is a wonderful person to know and a skilled and knowledgeable advocate in the Real Estate Industry.  When we finally move home, we will certainly have her help us again."
5,I Love working here.  The atmosphere and environment really do make people feel like they are home.  Everyone here is great to work with and fun to be around.
5,"Absolutely great!  Janice was thoughtful, courteous and professional. She helped me every step of the way and her knowledge of the local market was invaluable."
5,If it weren't for all of Janice's help and guidance I wouldn't have found the perfect home. Not only did she grasp the understanding of what we wanted but she always did her research and made sure we didn't make the wrong choice. You need someone like Janice to buy or sell who knows the surrounding area as well as she does.
5,"I worked with Janice Lobaugh and highly recommend anyone looking to buy or sell go through her!! She is absolutely wonderful, efficient, and makes the process seem effortless! Very happy \u2661"
5,My family and I couldn't be happier with the service we got from miriam guido. She was amazing. She is a very caring person that takes her job to the next level by treating her clients more like family than just a client. She also worked incredibly hard to find us the home that worked for us. I would strongly recommend her if you are buying a house and want an amazing experience.
5,"Jennifer Rath helped us find our dream retirement property. Now Jennifer, Janice and their team are helping us sell our house. VERY pleasant experience working with them!"
4,"The service provided was very good, and my agent definitely knew the market and all the details associated with the entire process. My house sold quite quickly!"
5,"I retired and moved out of state in late 2016, and along with that came the job of finding a buyer for my house in Palmer.\n\nJanice Lobaugh came highly recommended to me, which was a big help due to AK's sluggish economy. And since the house sold AFTER I moved, having Janice at the helm during that process took a big weight off my shoulders.\n\nThanks for your help, Janice! In spite of several bumps along the way, the task was done."
2,Very difficult to navigate the web site. Required to create account just to find anything out. Couldn't locate the house in question and ended up calling them to get a recording. Called my personal realtor to get the information needed.
5,Very knowledgable staff. Experience with HOP/Alaska Community Development corp and willing to work with that program. Available anytime for consulting if needed. Didn't feel rushed or like they care only about money to get their cut.
5,Miriam did a wonderful job helping us find our first home! They are all very dedicated to help everyone find their dream homes!
5,Janice with Alaska Premier is the best! I have always received the highest quality of service. I would recommend Alaska Premier to all!
5,"I have had the pleasure of knowing Janice for a number of years. I relocated to Wasilla six years ago. During that time I leased out my home and  also considered selling it.\nI can\u2019t count the number of times Janice was there for me to answer my questions, provide comparable comps on my home and assist me in numerous other area\u2019s both personal and professional.\nClient or not, Janice and Alaska Premier Real Estate staff always go above and beyond to help out any way they can.\n\nThank you\nSheryl Tichenor"
5,"I couldn\u2019t ask for better service than what I received from Miriam Guido! She has been there throughout my entire buying proceeds, answering all of my questions and being very flexible!"
5,I have worked with Janice Lobaugh and she is a great agent! She works to the best interest of her clients.
5,Janice sold our home when other realtors couldn\u2019t. We were impressed by her attention to detail and knowledge of the trends and process of real estate in our area.
5,Alaska Premier will research the property that you're looking at prior to you seeing the home and provide you with detailed information to help you  make an informed decision. Great customer service.
5,Janice is extremely knowledgeable and caring.  I am thrilled with the level of service that I have received from her.
5,"My daughter hired Alaska Premier Real Estate to sell her house, because she was involved in a divorce, and the court ordered her to sell fast and to get an aggressive agent. Meanwhile, my daughter moved due to job opportunities elsewhere. Consequently, I then took over as Power of Attorney for her in the house sale. Jance Lobaugh was wonderful to deal with throughout the sale. I had problems requesting renters to move and she directed me to the right laws governing rental agreements. She aggressively showed the house and handled everything including sending me documents to sign on my phone while I was on vacation. Ms. Lobaugh and her staff had to deal with a number of difficult legal situations and it was always professionally done. I would hire this company in a minute if I was selling my home. The firm is friendly but professional. Ms. Lobuagh and her staff responded immediately to all my questions and supportively walked me through the house's closing. In addition, she dealt with both my daughter's lawyers and her ex-husband's attorney as well. Thank you. Colette Grower"
5,"Great customer service skills, very knowledgeable in the market a wonderful experience working with them. I will go threw them again!"
5,Alaska Premier Real Estate have been AWESOME to work with!! I have been on my home buying journey with Janice over 3 years. Janice has persevered with me thru countless walk thrus and even more inquiries. But the staff kept my chin up throughout all my ups and downs during the prequalification phase and helped thru all the research on properties I showed interest in. I cannot rave long enough or loud enough about how loving and generous the ENTIRE staff at Alaska Premier Real Estate. I will FINALLY close next week and get the keys to my very first home!!! Thanks to Janice Lobaugh and her incredible team!! WE got a great deal on a great house for a great price. I can't thank you enough for ALL you've done for me and my family. GREAT JOB!!! Best wishes. Knowing that all your hard work pays dividends.
5,"We have done business with Janice Lobaugh many times in the past 10 years - as clients and as real estate partners. Janice is always an exemplary professional, always maintaining the highest ethics and integrity for her business and clients."

5,Absolutely loved the professionalism from Cody. He kept me informed and cleaned way more than I expected. My truck came out looking amazing. He even noticed I had a squeaky front passenger door and offered to lubricate it for me. He even detailed my mom\u2019s truck with the same level of professionalism. Truly like this guy and his work! I will definitely use his services again!
5,"These guys did awesome on my truck! I was driving home from anchorage and one of my kids got sick with severe stomach flu, and let me tell you; that drive home seemed way longer knowing a child was getting sick in the back with no On hand bags!\n\nMy husband was out of town and I was not able to leave my kids, these guys thankfully were able to meet up and grab my vehicle for me and drop off.\n\nThe interior looks better than brand new, did an amazing job on details! Also got some of the stomach flu and then some child stains out of the back!\n\nThank you auto details! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc"
5,"I wish I had taken before photos of my vehicle. When I dropped off my vehicle, there was dirt, crumbs, and a ridiculous amount of dog hair on the seats, roof, back of seats, in the console, etc from an international travel. Upon pick up, my vehicle looked brand new. There was no dog hair remaining in the vehicle, it was leather treated and scented. I am more than satisfied with the work Auto Details did on my car. I will be a repeat customer, as will my husband and I will be referring others. The 5% military discount was much appreciated as well!!"
5,Very knowledgeable crew that made my car look better inside that it did when I purchased it new. Very friendly and polite. Walks you through the cleaning and points out issues that they found. Will recommend to anyone needing a top notch new looking interior. Will be returning with other vehicles and looking to other services they offer as well. Not just a clean interior but a new interior.
5,"Very quick response time with quotes and getting a car in. I wanted to get my boyfriend interior of his truck detailed for him while he was out of town. He bought his truck used last year and was previously used by a construction worker. There was a lot of residual residue for him. My bf enjoys off-roading as well so there was a lot of dirt. Overall after i got the truck back, the interior was spotless. I have never seen it so clean. Residue gone. The seats and floor feel brand new. It also smells amazing now. Got the truck back within 24 hours. Cody also sent updates to me throughout the day. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for efficient and quality work."
5,"Had a great experience with an interior detail on my Subaru at Auto Details. Got me scheduled within a week, great communication, and easy pick up/drop off. He managed to make my car look like I don\u2019t have three kids that treat it like a trash receptacle! I was also treated to a Mother\u2019s Day gift which was super thoughtful and above and beyond. The best part is it was about $75 cheaper than 3 other companies I have used in the past. Will be bringing all of our vehicles here from now on!"
5,I was so impressed by Cody & his wife\u2019s work\u2014I did not think our older car could come out of there looking so wonderful! They went above and beyond and I plan to tell everyone that I know to go to Auto Details because they will not disappoint. They truly care and the pride they take in doing the best possible job is clearly evident!
5,We had a great experience at Auto Detailing in Wasilla. Cody was a professional and communicated very well. They were able to take us in short notice and still provide good quality auto detailing. I would recommend Auto Detailing to friends and family.
5,"This was my husbands birthday present, and he LOVED it!! Not only is it clean like new, but he professionally installed a floor board  lighting kit I bought on Amazon and put in my new seat covers and floor mats. It looks amazing! My husband was blown away! Great deal and a great job!"
5,More than detail oriented.  My GTR looks fabulous!  Thank you Cody!
5,"Cody is a very professional auto detailer, hands down will return if I ever let a vehicle get too dirty again. If you have food in the cracks and between your seats and between the seats and consoles, this is the place to go.  He was very communicative, timely, and provided a professional cleaning of our car making it feel like new again! 5/5"
5,"super professional dude, really nice to see from a garage business. easy to talk to and has good prices."
5,Thank you Cody and team for making our car and truck back to better than show room looking!! What a pleasure to drive away in a super clean car and truck.
5,"Wow. Cody took extreme care with my minivan. We have five growing children, and we try our hardest to keep it clean but it almost seems impossible. His attention to detail was top of the line. I couldn\u2019t believe how different everything looked. We will be repeat customers. I am very pleased with the service. Also not having to sit on wet seats for the drive home after I picked up the van was great! It was worth every penny, and the wife is happy too!!"
5,"Cody is a great guy. Always nice and pleasant to talk to. Did an amazing job on my car, and i couldnt be happier at how shiny and nice it turned out. Looks better than it did when i bought it. If ever i need my car done up again, he is my guy."

5,WOW! I bought a certificate for my mom for Mother\u2019s Day. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it! It looked better than brand new! He\u2019s super friendly and professional. He even left a few gifts for her!
5,"OMG!!! We took our 2006 Chevy truck to Cody. When we picked it up, it looked like a brand new truck. Cody is an outstanding communicator and business man. On time......on budget!!! We would highly recommend him to anyone wanting a quality, highly professional, and excellent job done. Thank you Cody!! We\u2019ll be back."

5,"Simply amazing!! I cant stop bragging about my car! It was AWFUL. I have 2 kids and am 8 months pregnant. I could not keep up with my car. It was bad. Cody did such an amazing job on it! It looks factory new in there! He also did so much extra stuff for my car and didn't charge me for them. He cleaned my key fob, added a febreeze type of thing into the system and sprayed all the rust spots on my car. Oh, and the price was awesome! It was half of what I was quoted at the other detailing shops!!"
5,"Cody was always quick to respond, squeezed me in so I could show car for sale and went above and beyond. Looked like a whole new vehicle. Will definitely be back. Thanks again!"
5,Extremely professional and the Tahoe looked better than new on the show floor! We are extremely pleased and highly recommend Cody and team. Awesome!!! Thank you!

5,The staff were very welcoming and made the whole process easy. I was greeted immediately when I walked through the door and impressive with the service I received.
5,"Clearly we chose well with Stevens Glass. Thank you for getting us in early and installing the new glass for our Chevy! You guys did a great job, and were very helpful and friendly..."
5,"Recently, I had Stevens Glass come to my home to address my window needs.  We had several windows need replacing to include one needing to be tempered.  They sent out one of their technicians who represented the Stevens Glass Family in the most professional manner.  The technician was courteous, knowledgable, and professional.  He took the time to explain what he was doing and why  he was doing it.  Stevens Glass worked up the order in a very timely manner and provided a reasonal quote for conducting the work.  The replacements have been made and we cannot be happier with the services we received.  Thank you Lonnie and Keri."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nI used Stevens Glass for a driver\u2019s side door window replacement. Due to their negligence and poor quality repairs I eventually had to replace the entire interior door panel to my truck (a costly claim to my insurance company).\n\nFirst, when they replaced the window the weather stripping was damaged, scratching the newly replaced glass/tint.\n\nI returned and requested they repair the weather stripping  - their solution was to bend the weather stripping back into place, instead of replacing it or repairing it correctly (leaving a large bend in the plastic).\n\nWhen I rolled the window down to test this repair, I realized the Roger\u2019s Glass employee had somehow bent the interior door panel in their repairs, resulting in increased pressure on the window and causing it to pop off of its frame / motor and drop down into the interior of my door.\n\nSo I returned a third time to give them an opportunity to correct the issue.\n\nStaff insisted the failed repairs were due to a gluing issue and did not address the bent door panel and instead re-glued the window (applied a large amount of two-part epoxy to the window and window frame).  I described to them how I noticed the bent door panel was applying pressure to the window. The window motor made more noise because of the increased work to move the window up and down. Also, as the window rolled down it tilted inside the truck. The staff completely ignored my comments and these obvious signs of damage.\n\nAt this point, I did not feel confident in the shop\u2019s ability to repair my truck and contacted my insurance company to submit a claim. The window and door panel were correctly repaired at local auto body shop.  With the door dismantled, I was able to see the interior of my door and my suspicions of poor repair were confirmed.\nWith the damaged door panel replaced, the window now rolls down without tilting forward or the sounds of a struggling motor."
5,"As a Realtor and Property Manager in the MatSu Valley, it is so nice knowing that Stevens Glass LLC is always there for any window and/or glass repair. Great customer service, fair pricing, & an all around wonderful locally owned business. Thank you Stevens Glass! We are lucky to have you in our community!"
5,"Got in and out real quick with new wiper blades too, and reasonable. Wonderful people too."
5,The installers were amazing.  They adjusted our shower glass to the millimeter and cleaned up after themselves.  They were also professional and polite!  Also the glass product was beautiful.  This is a great company to do business with if you need glass!
5,"I needed a particular glass that I could not find, Daniel did not only find it for me he had it cut and ready the next day! I went to six other glass places that were unable to help! I highly recommend the company!"
5,"What can I say. Perfect experience! Had a residential window with massive moisture in between the panes.  Got an estimate from another company(took a bit to get hold of them and didn't seem the most customer service oriented). Called Stevens to get a second quote. They answered the phone promptly, the receptionist was more than helpful. They gave me a date that fit my schedule. John showed up and explained what he could do. I got a call from their office the next day with a quote. It was $10 more than the other company but the customer service here was so much better than the other company the choice was easy. A week later they called to say the glass was ready and offered to install the next day. I chose Monday instead. John returned and did a fabulous job even with the wind gusting pretty badly. Thank you for the great service. My wife is ECSTATIC!!!"
5,Excellent friendly customer service - thank yOu!
5,"I was so impressed with my experience here! They worked with me and my insurance and got my windshield replace quickly. When I picked up my car, they had vacuumed, wiped down the dash and the other windows. I am so pleased and will be back!"
5,"This team has been amazing to work with offering excellent customer service and an awesome product! We\u2019ve used them at our home, on all our vehicles and for our construction business. They have been such a tremendous help and we are just so grateful for their services!"
5,I have used Steven\u2019s glass services many times for our windshields and for a broken side window.  They have done a great job each time with fair prices and prompt courteous service.  I highly recommend them.
5,"We have been using Stevens Glass for all our Home, Auto, and Business needs. The staff and representatives at Stevens Glass are so professional and efficient we wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone else! Quick, professional, clean, and friendly...how can you beat that!"
5,"Can take care of all your glass needs. When I needed a hard to get mirror, they found it, got it quickly, and installed it flawlessly"
5,"I had to get my windshield replaced and I was surprised by how fast and easy the whole experience was. Last year I used another company but they took a while on it, plus when I got my car back, the dashboard was a bit damaged. Steven's Glass got it done in 2 hours and were very friendly, plus no damage! I now recommend Stevens Glass to everyone I know who needs new glass!"
5,"Everyone who drives in Alaska knows they're going to need a new windshield eventually. I've had two done by Stevens Glass and couldn't be happier. Excellent customer service, friendly staff and quick service. Highly recommended!"
5,"\""I had my windshield replaced last Friday and everything went smooth. 2 gentlemen showed up to take my truck and returned in the 2 -3 hours expected but they also found a problem with my power window switch and fixed it at no charge.  Now that's service."
5,I had an exterior window pane crack at my home and Stevens did a fabulous job coming out the next day after my call to measure. When the replacement was complete it looked great!! Thank you!
5,I went in for a quote from Stevens Glass for some scratched glass replacement. They were very personable and fast. I was in and out in 5 minutes max.
5,I was happy with the quality of work along with friendly customer service throughout the process.
5,"When choosing a glass company in the Valley there is only one correct choice, Stevens Glass.  I have use two other big name franchises for glass in the Valley and only ended up with a sour taste in my mouth.  Not only is Stevens the best service they just happen to be the best price in the Valley too.  Stevens Glass, thank you so much for fixing my trucks, residential glass, custom shelving, some picture frames for my parents and commercial glass for my employer to name a few."
5,Very personable customer service. The only place I'll go to get my windshield replaced.
5,Good service
5,"I have a fleet of 10 vehicles and have been using Stevens Glass for 3 years now. They are quick, professional, and have great prices. I have also been using the for home windows. They are excellent!!!"
5,"I have used Steven's Glass for my family & our business.  They are very professional and great to work with.  Friendly, experienced and very knowledgeable of glass."
5,"Great service, and the level of integrity is tremendous. I would recommend these folks to everyone!!!"
5,Always go to guys great service
5,"Family run businesses are the way to go!  I have had such a great experience with Stevens Glass in the last month.  I have been there 4 times!!  I needed my shield repaired and they did a great job. After I drove around for a few days I realized that the rearview mirror was a lot lower than my previous windshield (it's how it came from the factory).  So I took it in and they tried to adjust it with no luck. They were going to try taking off the mirror using heat (which can sometimes crack the whole window).  So they ordered a NEW windshield for me to have on hand in case it cracked.  I was told that even if it did crack, I would not be responsible for any of the costs.  It wasn't even there \""fault\"" (it was how the factory made the window) and they took full responsibility.  The window did not crack and they fixed the problem.  And they even gave me a certificate for a free chip repair because of the \""hassle\"" I went through.  Which came in quite handy because 2-3 weeks later another rock hit my window.  I called them and they got me in within 30 minutes.  They are extremely nice and helpful.  Their waiting room is clean and they have wifi. I brought 2 small kids with me each time I had to go.  I would recommend them to anyone for any project/service."
5,OMG this is one of the best glass places I have used it's family owned and they treat you like your there only customer and they have the best prices I have came across
2,Poor experience with the manager. Decided to use another service provider due to the manager being unreasonable.

5,Very basic field for soccer. Bring your own chairs and portapotties. But it was only for 2 hours while granddaughter played soccer.  Grass had been mowed. No one brought dogs. Nice families.

5,"It's really beautiful island. Nizki Island is an uninhabited island in the Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska.Foxes were introduced to Nizki Island by Russian fur traders in the 19th century. This decimated the population of many bird species on the island. The last fox was removed from Nizki Island in 1976, and now Aleutian Canada Geese (once believed to be extinct), Puffins, and Aleutian Terns are common on the island"

1,"Worst company I've ever done business with. When they show up to the job site ill prepared, then charge you for the time for going back to the shop (twice they had to leave to get stuff, when you come out a week before the job to evaluate what you will need to have to get the job done... then charge the customer for your \""oops, forgot something\"". Just know, the clock is still \""running\"" while they sit in your driveway eating lunch @ $250 an hour. Then, charge your credit card 2 grand for a $900 job. But, you don't know they over changed untill it's to late, the CC company can't do anything, They ignore the BBB, they ignore you. And they'll erase this review like they did my last one. If this is a new company (owner) contact me. I had to select 1 star because there isn't a zero star.\n\nIn response to the response received: 2 people @ $125 each, was costing me $250 an hour to watch them eat (unbeknownst to me at the time).\n\nWhen it was time to pay the bill, I was told the \""system\"" was down, they would email me a receipt, so I went ahead and gave the tech my CC info in good faith. Took over a  week, after prodding, to get it. Tooooo late to contest it through the CC company, and treated very dismissive by the owner. As for the tech who did the work, nice to know he is no longer working for you, but now we don't know where he's at. That still doesn't make amends to how this matter was and still being \""handled\"" I see."

5,"We always stay here when in Valdez for silver salmon fishing. The elderly couple that run it are amazing to talk to, extremely helpful. The campsites are very well maintained."
5,This was an amazing RV camping experience with good electric water - the owner even pumped our septic. They have a great little store with groceries and souvenirs - we got to know some of the other campers and every where we went they were very happy with the site. We used laundry and shower area and everything was very clean. Enjoy!
5,Spent the summer of 2011. Had a wonderful time.\n2014 Just spent a 2nd Wonderful summer at this park. Very nice quiet park surrounded with trees. Very clean restrooms and the park was kept clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
5,"My Wife and I have stayed at Bear Creek several times over the past 5 years, and it continues to be the only place that we'll stay near Valdez.  Tim and LaVerne are wonderful hosts, and run a great campground.  Best thing is, its a few miles out of the \""hustle and bustle\"" of busy Valdez... nice place guys!  :)"
5,"Great campground for the price. Nice hot unlimited showers, laundy, and  spacious wooded lots. Full hook ups. Late check in available."
4,"We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open.\n\nThere is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold.\n\nWi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again."
5,"I like the park, it's new still making improvements, I am Glad that I was able to get in with out a reservation, the staff is very good, cable TV needs work got one channel with antenna, no sewer at site but they do have a dump site."
4,"This place is just a few miles outside Valdez, which I thought was a bonus.  It was surrounded by woods and had some trees throughout the park for shade.  The bathrooms were clean and the showers were nice.  The dump station was a little underwhelming.  Overall, I'm really glad I stayed here and not one of the gravel lots in valdez."
5,Probably the nicest and cleanest campground we've been to in Alaska.
1,Treated terribly by owner absolutely outrageous pricing wouldn't even allow me to shower after paying almost 40.00 for just parking in a lot for 5 hours
5,Stayed there all summer in 2014 and gonna stay there this year. Great place nice people
5,"Nice people, clean bathrooms with cloth bath mats too!"
3,Noisy in the morning(RV's leaving). A little cramped. Other than that a nice place to stay.
3,"Beautful setting plenty of room for a big rig, but no sanation at the site. Strong Wi-Fi with very good cable tv. THIS IS NOW VALDEZ KOA"
5,"Great, slept like a bear. Clean, convenient, cute, the owners are a hoot."
5,"Well maintained, excellent amenities, sites are conveniently accessible"
5,Very nice cabin
5,Cool
5,It is always a treat to visit this rain or shine. So much to say but I'll sum it up with photos.
3,"We went on a Friday, it was still fun, but apparently there\u2019s less than half the usual vendors. The pictures below show the huge empty area that is supposed to be full! We were disappointed at how few stalls there were. There were maybe 20 in all, and for a long while we were the only buyers, which might explain the lack of booths. It was mostly jewelry, with a smattering of antler art and t shirts and a few (overpriced) food vendors. They said Saturday is the best day, I\u2019d definitely go then if you can!"
4,Only 3 booths with mainly vegetables. More expensive than the stores but the produce looked pretty good. The tomatoes were a nice deep red. Tomorrow I'll see if they taste better. I'm trying to eat healthier. I miss the fruits tho'.
5,We went to the mall looking for gifts to take back home but everything was closed. Luckily this market was right outside with a few vendors. We got what we needed and they had a decent selection of food and gifts. Happy to have found it despite not knowing it existed
4,Good market but kind of a small selection of vendors\u2026
2,Not a lot going on here since it moved from downtown. Check out a farmers market somewhere else. Try find where Grandma Wei moved to!

5,"Great help, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. I was impress by the turn around time, and the fact that he was able to service my trailer so quickly. Other shops in my area were telling me that an appointment were a month out, I got serviced in two days. It was worth the trip from Anchorage. Give Max a call!"
5,Matt was honest and did the work done as promised date.
5,"Our little Scamp camper needed some TLC and Happy Camper did a wonderful job checking the electrical, window seals, and minor fixes. Professional service and excellent value - highly recommended!"
5,They are very fair and fast. Highly recommend his services.
5,"Max at Happy Camper is the best. Happy Camper installed a generator for my 5th wheel, great work. I was so pleased that I have taken my rig back for a slide out repair. No worries here."
5,Excellent work done at a fair price and in a timely manner way better pricing than the other places in the area.
5,"Extremely easy to work with. Highly accommodating.  Never once had an issue reaching him by phone. Was a little concerned at first with the couple of negative reviews but decided to try it anyway. So glad I did because I haven't received this high quality of customer service in a long time. I thought I needed a new water heater that he could have easily charged me for, turns out I didn't need one. Thats the kind of service a female like myself appreciates when dealing with repair shops. I won't take my trailer anywhere else for repairs but here."
5,Max is awesome to work with very nice guy!
2,"Unfortunately, I haven't been able to be graced by Max's great service that the other reviewers have left because I haven't been able to get a hold of him. It would be my advice to add an answering machine to the phone line, so customers could leave a message.  Based on reviews of other RV repair shops I am hesitant to have my converter replace anywhere else."
5,"I've used Happy Camper RV for three or four years. Max handles my Jayco pop-up trailer when most Alaskan repair places won't commit to it. Prices fair and on time. He works alone as far as I can tell, so gets very busy in early spring and late fall, but he schedules the work and I've only needed to schedule my drop off once. Pickup always as agreed.\n\nI really like guys who do the job without fanfare and at a good price. Max is one."
5,"I called the Happy Camper RV with a problem involving my refrigerator and needed it repaired for a trip the following day.  Though this was very short notice they got me in and made the repair in about two hours. I was flabbergasted! This is without doubt, the man I will use from now on for all of the repairs he can perform for me on my RV.  Exellent Job!  Excellent Service!"
5,Very nice and reliable.professional rv service.one of the best i have ever been to
5,"So I pull into Eagle River in Feb from Michigan pulling an overloaded toy hauler and once I get unloaded at my new apartment, I discover that my electric tongue jack has stopped working. I leave a message after business hours Friday night and get a call back Saturday morning. The owner tries walking me thru a few simple remedies to fix but after no luck, he tells me to drop it at his shop and he will take a look. On Monday morning at 10.30am, I get a call that it is fixed. When I pick it up, the jack is rewired and working AND it has been washed from 4,000 miles of crude. I was charged a very fair fee and was on my way! I am very happy with this business' service and highly recommend them!"
5,"I am so grateful to have found Max. He fixed my spring and Furnace in my Jayco Popup, when I thought it was a goner, and at a reasonable price. I am once again a \u201cHappy Camper\u201d Highly recommend."
5,"I need my refrigerator replaced,for it done quick and the job he did was awesome,very clean work performed,Thank You."
5,"We came in from out of town and had a serious problem with our base plate on a car that we were towing behind our motorhome. Called late in the day and Max returned my call and opened up a morning time to look at it. His son gave me a ride back to where the motorhome was and delivered the car there after the repair. To say I was pleased with the service would be an understatement, and he was very fair with the parts and labor. Thanks, Max."
5,Always pleased with the great quick service at a fair price.  Max is always attentive to detail.
1,"This may be a fabulous business but after two calls with messages left and no response from them, I'd have to say that they may be a really good mechanic but don't do a very good job of managing their business and customer service.  I guess I'll go to Anchorage to have my water leak diagnosed and repaired!"
5,Always pleased with the value and the work. This man loves what he does for a living.
5,"Always great service, honest and fast."
5,Max is one of the few honest guys you'll find in this racket.
5,Probably the best service in the Valley.

5,"Do yourself a favor, do Anchorage a favor, do foodies everywhere a favor and stop by the Cajun Corner downtown and enjoy some of the best Alaskan seafood and Southern fare. The North's best Southern blessed buckets of seasoned buttery soul food. It's all in there if you want it, from King crab to crawdads. I paid for extra in the bucket but the regular portions in other dishes we saw seemed fair as well. I stopped in just to see what it was about, grab a beer and maybe a bite, I'm glad I stayed for so much more. Support local, savor the flavors and say hi to Pat who'll be throwing down all this goodness over a single stove top. The space is clean, beautifully decorated, ideally located in the heart of downtown and a great atmosphere for meeting friends. I'll be back for sure."
5,"Great place to eat. The chef, Patrick, was a fun and inviting person. He is one of those people you feel you can trust and he sure can cook some crawdads. Shannon was a great host, checking on us frequently. Great first experience."
5,Fantastic service and food!! Every bite we took here was jaw dropping! Come! Eat! Enjoy!! We loved being at the Cajun Corner!
5,Great flavor! I had the seafood gumbo and Shrimp basket. My buddies only had the Jumbalaya and said it could use more rice. For $16 they weren't full afterwards. That's not super surprising since these dishes are more expensive usually. The restaurant is newer and I expect they'll do very well.
5,Amazing place!!!!! A gem!!! We were walking around downtown looking for place to eat with no luck 
5,I had the jambalaya and the gumbo and both were the most delicious I\u2019ve ever had. The gumbo was my favorite though. Great atmosphere and extremely friendly owners. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try more!
5,Stopped in after trolley tour. Food was delicious and dessert was very good too!! Prices were comparable to area...a little bit higher than I am used to but food and service was great!!
5,"Very cool place to visit when you're in Anchorage. Friendly staff, nice local beer selection and tremendous Cajun food (coming from someone that lives on the US Gulf Coast.  Please check this place out!"
1,"The people were very nice but portions are waaaaaaayy too small for the price. For $9 I got 4 small catfish nuggets along with flavorless red beans and rice. The menu said 2 pieces of fish so I was expecting 2 catfish fillets. For the amount of food that was given, it should have been listed as an appetizer! I wish I would have taken a picture to post. I also ordered okra but it took too long so I canceled my order. Fish and beans were also room temperature. This place was newly opened but the portion sizes and the lack of flavor have nothing to do with that. Sorry but I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone and definitely won\u2019t be returning. The kitchen is also too small for what they are trying to do."
5,"THE LINE OUT THE DOOR WAS WORTH STANDING IN. WHAT A GREAT LITTLE GEM IN ANCHORAGE. HAD A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE, WITH VERY FRIENDLY SERVERS. MY FOOD WAS HOT AND FULL OF FLAVOR. THANKS!!!"
5,"Delicious! My family and I came to celebrate my dad\u2019s 53rd birthday. Everything tasted delicious, and the service was outstanding! I\u2019m glad I could check it out on my visit. Will be back for more!"
5,"Best downtown spot for Seafood and cajun food, I just had the best date her with my wife. The owner and staff were friendly and added to an already amazing experience."
5,"Great food, good beer, awesome people!\n\nJambalaya and gumbo were outstanding and the atmosphere cannot be beat."
5,"They are a new establishment. 5 days old. Great food but they are overwhelmed especially because the city favorite 49 state brewery was closed.\nShannon and her Chef are dishing out some spice to Anchorage. They need a web presence (Google, Yelp and TripAdvisor).\nGood luck. You got the recipient for the food the rest will fall in place as your clientele grows."

From stealing my money that was intended to be given back to me, until threatening me with the idea that he is going to call the police, the owner doesn\u2019t deserve anyone to support him. Really think twice if you\u2019re willing to live here, and if you do, remember to take pictures of everything before you are charged for damages you didn\u2019t make at all."
1,"Didn't rent a room here because of the \""run-around.\"" Could barely get ahold of the owner. And, when I did, he was in Texas! I still couldn't rent a room because, there wasn't anyone else that could do the paperwork. If you rent from here, make sure the owner is available, and has the staff needed to handle your concerns."
1,Definitely won't be staying here again the owner or so called owner his name is Chris and I tried getting my deposit back and he said I have to wait a week to see if there is any damages I said no I need my deposit now to get me another room tonight he said now ur not getting ur deposit at all and blocked my number and never even went upstairs I guess it's because he is broke and he needed it  but nowm out on the street with no where to sleep tonight

When I asked for my cash he reluctantly handed it over, slammed the trunk and told me and my 13 year old son \u201cdon\u2019t come back\u201d.\nWe will come back but will not use this service.\nExpecting a tip for a $14 fare that took him less than 10 minutes to drive?\n\nHe must read his reviews. 15 minutes after this post he texted me with expletives, obscenities, and challenged me to fight him.\n\nReally?\n\nOver $4.00?\n\nProbably a reaction to the vaccine?\n\nThe cab said \u201cCity Taxi\u201d after I called the number for city taxi. Were I the owner I would disavow this driver or claim some covid excuse as well."
4,The driver is very knowledgeable of the city and I appreciate that. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five stars is because he picked me up from the airport and then a few days later drop me off to the airport The first time I wrote with him it was amazing he told me everything about everything second time he kind of felt more like a tour guide than a taxi driver which obviously has his pros and cons.\nPros
5,Dave provided outstanding service.   plane was delayed 4 hours late into the night and he still provided us with a ride with no additional charges.  extremely friendly and very knowledgeable of the area.  he was. like our own personal tour guide.  the only taxi I will use in the future.
5,Compared to the other taxi companies in Anchorage these guys were great. The communication I got was outstanding.
1,Call for a cab and nobody showed up. After I posted this a few days later they texted me demanding I take this post down. Then tried to argue a tell me what I said. The phone operator said the wrong street I corrected the operator but they didn\u2019t pay attention and still sent there drive to the wrong location. This company is very unprofessional. Use there services at your own risk! \u26a0\ufe0f

Couldn\u2019t unlock it because the battery was dead, and couldn\u2019t charge it because the doors were locked because the battery was dead so he made extra trip  To come back and jump it and now it\u2019s charging! Thank you so much Tim for your help."

The driver, who was the owner, was kind and spoke to us in a way that I really appreciated. The car itself was very nice on the inside and very clean and tidy. Any time we\u2019re in anchorage we\u2019ll definitely be using their services in the future as well. Great company overall"
1,"I called to order a cab and they were friendly. I got offered a ride from a nice person I met at moose\u2019s tooth and called back to cancel about 4 minutes after. The response I got was \u201coh yeah, just waste peoples time\u201d. I got offered a free ride, and called to let them know. I am also a cab driver in Homer, and I appreciate when people let me know when they have secured another ride. I will never call this business again. A bad attitude gets you NO WHERE. Appreciate when someone lets you know they won\u2019t be there, I could have left you hanging.\n\nIn response to the owner of this business posting my private information online, I would have to say there is your proof that this company is unprofessional and untrustworthy. If you have a negative experience with them and chose to review them, they will retaliate. Thank you city taxi for proving my point for me."
5,First class service.  A delight to find in a taxi service.
1,"WOW... Did this company really just release someone's personal number...? That seems very unprofessional. Let me get this straight. You got a bad review, and lashed out with someone's personal info? Say there, what's your number? I'd like to share it with.... NO ONE! Because that doesn't seem right."
5,Great experience. This was my first ride with City Taxi. The car was very clean - didn't smell bad either (bonus points!). The driver was on time and professional. I'm definitely going to use this company as my primary taxi from now on. Highly recommend!
1,Looking at your reviews tonight while choosing a cab service for an upcoming trip to Anchorage - an owner who berates folks for their political beliefs and posts folks phone numbers is someone I'll never do business with and recommend to others that choose other options as well. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! Stay classy Mr. Business owner - I AM NOT an internet stalker. I'm a person who reads reviews on businesses. You are a simple cyber bully who does not wish to correct YOUR UNPROFESSIONAL WRONGS!
1,"Scheduled a ride through the app (the day before) and they never showed up. Didn't answer their phone or call back. Won't be trying them again!\n\nEdit: I see the owner has responded 9 months later. After I left the review, they texted me to say \""sorry about yesterday you fell through the cracks plus we've got some flu at the shop here\"" (that's a direct quote) and offered to reimburse my fare (up to $25) with the other taxi company I ended up taking - which seemed like a pretty clear admission that they had dropped the ball. I never responded because this had been a ride scheduled to the airport to catch an early flight for work, and a $25 reimbursement couldn't change the fact that I'd been left scrambling for a ride at the last minute. Not sure why they are trying to change their story now. This was my first time using their app, but I am computer/phone/app-literate and paid close attention because this was an important ride; the app had indicated that my ride was confirmed and certainly didn't say anything about taxis being unavailable. That was a failing somewhere in the app or company rather than user error. I wish City Taxi well and hope they have improved their process so as not to leave customers hanging, but I still won't be using them (or trying to!) again."
1,Numbers down not sure of this company is still in buisness.
1,Said they won\u2019t come to old Seward and 70th don\u2019t have service in that area
3,It was okay
5,Great service and great conversation!  Would highly recommend.
1,Couldn't get through to dispatch and did not use due to this.
5,"Great service. Arrived early, car was very clean, and customer service was spot on. Would recommend."
5,"On time, polite, good drivers, shares information about the city and State of Alaska."
5,Very quick to respond with a taxi after requesting one. Seems like a good alternative to yellow and checker cabs.
1,"I got cut off by cab #169, no blinker, almost hit my car so I honked and he flipped me off.  Called it in and the owner answered- no apology just arguments.  Never heard of this company but I work at a hotel and would rather sit and wait for Yellow Cab to answer than use City Taxi"
1,"Very rude people. I had to call back and ask for a taxi that would fit 4 adult and a kid, the man who answered rudely said you know what we can\u2019t keep sending taxis out to you just call someone else. No one even came out and showed up. So how would it hurt to send someone with a bigger car. Very disrespectful. Don\u2019t take this cab company just can yellow cab their much nicer. If I could rate this zero stars I would"
5,Very friendly. Only cab I\u2019ll take.
1,"Worst service ever. Save your time, use Ubee or Lfty."

5,Seriously amazing breakfast burrito!
5,"We ate here 3 times and enjoyed the best of what Alaska has to offer.   Met the owner and viewed his family owned operation.  A must place to eat while in Petersburg and take home fresh fish , smoked or other.   5 Star"
5,Best breakfast in town. Fast and friendly staff.
5,Cool fish market with good chow
5,Amazing halibut. Wow!
5,"I have been going to Petersburg for the past 7 years. Coastal has been great to work with, prompt and reliable. From the fish processing to the Fish Tacos it is a must stop both coming and going. Just good people to work with, Greg gave me some tips last year to help keep my fish fresh and he is spot on. Looking forward to this year and the years to follow. 2015 I will have my 10 year old grandson with me and will want him to see how they handle his catch."
5,"Shop here for the best seafood in all of Alaska. I sure do miss you guys.\nRespectfully,\nNanette Jackson-"
4,"My favorite part of this establishment was eating lunch here. The food was very good.\n\nThe other part I liked about this place is after a day of fishing, Doug the manager, was waiting for us at the dock where he took our Halibut catch to Coastal Cold Storage to process for shipping back to Nebraska.\n\nWe added some smoked salmon strips (yum) and some rockfish to our shipment and we are stocked until our next return to Petersburg"
5,"Been a long time since I been here, and I can't wait to return. Especially for the halibut bits!"
5,"Coastal was great to us, been going there for several years, thanks Doug"
5,I must get the salmon dip every time I visit Petersburg.
5,Never disappointed when I eat here!
5,Best to work with and fast delivery
5,Excellent shrimp burger and good seafood plane and simple

4,Not bad place. Good coffee. I really don't  care about the internet when at coffee places. It's all about the coffee. If you can't connect move on and stop whining.
3,"this coffee house is small but they serve good tasting coffee, much better than the bitter Starbucks brand.\n\nThey did not serve breakfast croissants or any hot sandwiches but they do have a few scones"
1,"There are two coffee shops in Petersburg. I come to this one because the wifi is pretty good. I come in, order my coffee, and try to connect to the internet, the wifi is down. I tell the girl behind the counter, she says that she will check on it after she makes all the coffee. There is no one else here, the internet is still down.  Very bad customer service. Will not come here again. Will tell everyone so know not to come here again."
5,"Perfect if you just want a good coffee with free Wi-Fi. They also have bagels, muffins etc. And don't miss their iced teas!"
4,Awesome coffee pl.better then glacier coffee and starbuck put to gether.the girls there do a fantastic job making that special coffee for you\nIt is now officially changed over  to common ground  coffee  java his is no longer in business Thant britni you done good taking over to push glacier coffee that much over
5,Trip was years and years ago but staff was quite friendly and gladly contended with our roudy troop.
2,Coffee is good for a while but a smile could change a DAY!
5,I love this cafe I recommend it
5,Quality local radio. Lots of awesome live performaces from Alaskan artists here. A nice place where nice people are.
5,"The KTOO building houses KTOO, KXLL and KRNN, our local public radio stations. The building has several recording studios as well as a public studio space which can be used for public broadcasts or events.\n\nKTOO is also home to 360 North, a television station focused on public and regional affairs. Gavel Alaska is a service of KTOO that brings coverage of the geographically isolated state legislature to remote parts of the state.\n\nEveryone in the building is super friendly and helpful, like they're all characters from some 1970's episode of Sesame Street."
5,Great staff as well as divergent programming! Love to listen to the station!
5,"Attended a Chamber event here in the studio, the location, staff and all settings were top notch."

5,"Here's what I like about Augustus Brown Swimming Pool: it's like Cheers: \""everybody knows your name.\"" It is convenient for me. It is the best fitness deal around (if you buy a pass), and most of all, the staff is fantastic (thanks to Chris, Kollin, and Mackenzie, et.al.)!"
5,The kids pool is Sooooo warm.
5,"Old school, but my favorite pool in Juneau for what I do (mostly laps)."
5,"I love this pool. It's an old facility and doesn't have a lot of fancy stuff, but it does its job being a center of community very well."
5,"Clean, well-staffed, salt-water! Remember quarters for the lockers."
5,Staff was very helpful getting grandson signed up for swimming lessons!  Thank you
5,Best fitness deal in town. I'm always happier after a visit.

3,We would here mostly just to mail some postcards. We didn't stay long because we felt more like covid threats than customers.
5,It's one of my favorite shops in Juneau.  There is so much to discover and you couldn't find nicer people to help you.  It's locally owned and a huge supporter of Juneau!  It's a true gem in Downtown Juneau!
5,Fun artsy shop! I love that they only sell handmade jewelry. We also bought some items that they shipped to us. Everything went smoothly and the employees are very fun and helpful! Cutest stuff here. Gotta check it out!
5,One of my favorite stores in all of Alaska. Every visit to Juneau calls for a visit however brief it may be to Kindred Post. They have the very best greeting cards and post cards. Plus they make it so easy to mail just about anything. The staff here are always so welcoming and warm. The very best of Juneau!!
5,"I found this shop on my last visit to Juneau and highly recommend it. There\u2019s a contract Post Office inside and they make shipping easy with a large supply of boxes, a space to pack and label your items, and free tape and bubble wrap. The gift shop portion has a great selection of really interesting items. But their best feature is their incredibly friendly staff."
5,By far the coolest post office I've ever been to. They have a great little stationary/gift shop and they host community events. Great people who support great causes.  They seem to understand the importance of relationships.
5,Awesome! A post office? Sure. But the quality of goods they have for sale here is like nothing I've seen anywhere else. Looking for a gift to give to family back home?  This place is great. A slice of individuality in an area with lots of the same stuff for sale.
5,"Best post office ever!  Great location; quick, friendly service; delightful art, unique gifts and souvenirs.  Popular with locals and tourists alike."
